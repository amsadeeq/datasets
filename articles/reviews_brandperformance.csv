40,4-Feb-20,"Excellant food, served with enthusiasm","Yes, the food was wonderful. Regular stuff, along with some exceptional dishes.. Especially, the dessert called as Budha's Foo. Curious about the name, we asked for the description. The dish was explained with so much passion, that we had to order it. It did meet our expectations, however, I thought that quantity could have been more.. I would strongly recommend this restaurant for its taste and wonderful service..",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai

50,5-Dec-19,Best hospitality + brilliant food,"Inarguable the best restaurant of 2019 in terms of hospitality. Best service ever received & amount of ethics they have in their work is just excellent. Shubham who was serving us was the most humble person you will ever come across in any hotel.Situated right beside of worli seaface & yet its not that expensive. It's an Asian Bistro who also have a buffet at very attractive price. We didn't opted for the buffet because it was not available but we eat like it was buffet.We had chicken ramen soup, Chicken mandarin kabab, chicken salad, raw mango salad, raw mango drink, Japanese cooler, orange spritizer, noodles, puddings, ice-cream & then Japanese tea to improve the digestion because we wer forced to.No doubt food quality & quantity was excellent. Chicken was damn fresh & it was my first time i was having ramen & i loved it. Drinks was also nice but desserts was mind blowing. Presentation of every dish was also very gorgeous.Overall it's a excellent place to enjoy unlimited Asian cuisine at affordable price, plus you get good food & top level service.

40,25-Jul-18,Authentic chinese food,"With the Chinese New Year on 16th February, China Bistro has kept a food festival in that honor from 12th February to 3rd March 2018. I happened to try this and hence would like you guys to know about it too. They have a set menu for this day which has soups, salads, dimsums, Bao’s, Grilled items and also mains like pot rice.Location and proximity from Station:There are 4 outlets in Bombay. We happened to visit the one in Dadar west. It is a 15 minute walk from Dadar station or a 5-10 minute cab ride depending on the traffic.Ambiance and seating:The ambiance is of the basic fine dine place. It’s really good and you can focus on your company and food both easily. There’s ample of space and they can seat over 50 people easily. No issues of space congestion also.Food and Drinks:We started off with few mock-tails and cocktails.Insane Russian (restaurant menu)- The basic vodka + Kahlua mixture on the rocks. I am not a vodka fan but this mixture definitely changes my mind. There was a strong sweetish taste to it. Please do try thisApple basil martini (restaurant menu) - The staff suggested this as it works out well for most of their customers. Sure enough it worked out well for us too. The only negative here is that the basil was strong and overpowered the entire drink. Any way we did like it.Peach iced tea (restaurant menu) - We tried an iced tea and the flavor was very good. Did pack a punch and if you are a fan of the iced teas do try either this or the lemon iced tea.Porto Red Sangria (restaurant menu) - They have the Sonora, Blonde and the Porto sangria. I’m a fan of the red wine and hence tried the Porto. It’s quite decent and not much on the sweeter side.Truffle scented mushroom tea - We then began with the appetizers. The first to walk in was the soup. The shiitake mushrooms really go well and there’s a punch of flavor and spice in it. Definitely begin with this in your meal.Steamed chicken and spinach dumpling - The best part about this is that it’s not your average dough covering for the dim sum. It’s of spinach leaves. And yes, the result is fantastic. The meat and spinach go so well along with the chilli bean sauce.Three lung har gaurav with tobiko (prawns) - It’s quite rare to have dumplings in BLACK color. This is made up of squid ink and rice flour. I am not a fan of prawns but my mother loved it. It’s accompanied with red thai curry and the taste is decent.Urumqi lamb bao pocket - Here the bao pockets have carrots, cucumber, hummus and spinach along with the meat which is the lamb. You might feel this is dry and hence can have the red thai curry sauce. We found the taste decent and this could have been a bit better.Fire roasted mandarin chicken (restaurant menu)- This one’s not present in the new year menu but you must try this anyway. The chicken is seasoned with spices and is deep fried on skewers and is served on a mini charcoal grill. The taste here is really good and has the spice to keep you wanting more. Kudos to the staff for suggesting this.Hot Pot chicken rice - I like the concept of the pot rice. The sauce, the rice , the veggies and the meat mixed in good proportion to suit the taste for all. Here too was the same case. The taste was good and it’s not spicy. Also, it’s a lot of quantity and that’s good too.Desserts:Green Tea Tiramisu - One of the best desserts I’ve dared to try. I like my green tea and also my tiramisu. But the thought of the mixture gave me the jitters. Thankfully the staff there convinced me that it’s really good and many have liked it. Fortunately for them I really loved it. This is fantastic. None of them overpower each other. The mixture will give you a balanced taste of both.Conclusion:Overall, the chinese new year menu is reasonable as per what I had. The appetizers range between 300-450 and the mains are from 450 - 600. The cocktails and mocktails are not present in the new years menu and is present in the restaurant menu.A special mention to the staff who are always on their toes to help and will also give you good suggestions. They made us try a dish off the menu and we are fortunate that they helped us understand the good food these guys can serve.I urge you to try this place and head over before the chinese new year menu ends which is on the 3rd of March 2018.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-or20-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai

40,11-Mar-18,Food A+ service not so much,"Let me start of by saying that this visit was for the lunch buffet. Value for the $$$ Outstanding. Rs.700 for a buffet along with a glass of wine which came well after we finished our main course. Initially I booked the lunch through easydining website however by sheer luck when I called to confirm my booking I was initially told that they had not received my booking. Then after around a couple of minutes they located my booking and then they told me that they were fully booked for my time slot and they could not accommodate my booking. I then asked my friend to call in as he is a regular there and sure enough they got him a table for the same time slot that I had previously booked. When we arrived there we were given the table and when I pointed this out to the hostess all I got in return was a ""uh Ok"". China Bistro management your are in the hospitality business you need to really work on your customer service skills. at our table some of the seating assignments were missing cutlery and when we requested the same the same was replenished in a timely manner. That is where the negative stuff ends now coming to the food. In 2 words ""SIMLY MINDBLOWING"". Be it the fish or the chicken or lobsters or crabs each one of them had their own unique flavours and taste. All in all it was not a bad experience but it can certainly be something that can be improved upon. The 4 star rating is for the food and food alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-or30-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai

You can’t miss this. It’s full of flavor and smells delicious.For the starters tried the pickled mustard and chestnut dumpling, steamed chicken and spinach dumpling with chili bean, veg & barbecued chicken bao pockets. The dumplings were steaming hot and flavorsome although found the pocket baos too dry!For the main course tried the hot pot meal which had exotic vegetables in yellow bean sauce mixed with steaming rice. It was perfectly made and steaming hot!Couldn’t try their green tea tiramisu as they were out of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-or30-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai
40,8-Mar-18,Chinese New Year Menu,"4.0 in Fine Dine, Chinese Cuisine ( Mumbai )""Chinese food tries to engage the mind, not just the palate. To provoke the intellect."" -Nicole MonesThe onset of spring brings in the joyous occasion of the Chinese New Year. To celebrate the mirthful spring festival, China Bistro, known for its authentic & contemporary Chinese dishes, has prepared a special menu with some interesting delicacies available at all their outlets. To get a taste of the celebratory menu, we decided to drop by their Dadar outlet with stands tall as a very well-known landmark, taking over an entire corner of a prominent street.Replicas of the Terracotta Army, red paper lanterns & prominent elements of the Chinese culture are found all around the beautifully lit restaurant. As a part of the new year celebrations, China Bistro also has a little table on which they pay their respects to the ingredients they use in the food.FoodTo get your taste buds going while you decide what you want to order, you are served with Kimchi, pickled carrots & cucumber, fragrant chilli sauce & a black pepper sauce.Let us warn you, they are incredibly addictive!Truffle Scented Mushroom Tea ( Rs.145 )When we read the name of the tea, we assumed we were going to get a mellow tea infused with the flavours of Truffle & mushroom… but we were quite mistaken. The tea is like a soup served in a beautiful tall kettle with cute little China Teacups & saucers to accompany it. In the cups, you get thin, sliced & dried shiitake mushrooms on which you pour the piping hot mushroom truffle broth. If you had any doubts that there was any truffle in the tea, the earthy aroma will put them to rest. The soup is light in consistency but packed with flavour. It has a slight pungency owing to the truffles, a rich buttery flavour of the shiitake & a spicy ( hints of sour ) tinge owing to the spices. This is a MUST HAVE.Thai Papaya Salad with Orange Vinaigrette ( Rs.195 )The base of the dish was crunchy Raw Papaya juliennes and along with it were julienned carrots, French beans, Heirloom tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, peanuts, garnished with edible flowers. The salad was dressed in a fresh orange juice ( which we give extra points for )... A Delicious salad!Dumplings or Dim sumsWhat we loved the most about their dumplings, in general, were their innovative wraps that were made with a variety of flavours and ingredients. Instead of just using a mix of rice flour or a basic dumpling dough, they used vegetables such as spinach and flavoured wraps. Commenting on the consistency, the coating would give a pop of flavour and melt in your mouth enabling the filling to be the hero. Every dumpling dish had its own personality, so to speak. Each of them were very different not only in flavour but in presentation & look too. The dumpling platter was decorated with micro greens, edible flowers and a variety of sauces. Certainly, a treat to look at… and devour!Pak Choi & Shiitake Dumpling ( Rs.275 )Green little siu mai dumplings were dressed up with micro greens & fried onions with a filling of soft juicy mushroom & boiled Bok Choy. On top of it, all were drizzled a few drops of parsley mayo. Even though there was a lot going on with the crispy onions, the earthy mushrooms, light mustard flavour from the greens and bok choy… it all blended perfectly.Three Lung Har Gao with Tobiko( Rs.325 )Placed on a bed of Red Thai curry were Black Dumplings… yes black! The dumpling dough is made up of rice flour & squid ink. Now the taste of the coat in no way overpowers the dish but is very very subtle. The dumpling dough is filled with lightly flavoured prawn, bamboo shoots & some water chestnut and is garnished with Microgreens and tiny little tobiko. Tobiko are the tiny pink pearls on top of the dumpling, also known as flying fish roe, which give it a blink & miss salty taste. The dumplings are beautiful to look at and we strongly recommend you try them. Be careful while eating with chopsticks, this dumpling can give you quite the slip !Steam Chicken & Spinach Dumpling with Chilli Bean( Rs.325 )Two green dumplings were placed in a little puddle of Chilli Bean Soya Sauce, garnished with micro-greens. Now, these dumplings weren’t made up of the usual dumpling dough but the coating was, in fact, beautiful, soft spinach leaves. Tucked inside the leaves was succulent, steamed chicken meat. The spinach was very tender and let the taste of the chicken come through while the spicy, umami Chilli bean sauce is fun to dunk in for a change of taste.Bao PocketsBarbecue Chicken ( Rs.395 ) / Urumqi Lamb ( Rs.295 )Who isn’t well versed with the soft-sweet Chinese bread? Our only complaint with them is that just like a burger we managed to drop the filling everywhere. To make sure you get the tasty goodness of every bit of from the filling, they have made bao pockets. We had two varieties of the Bao pockets which were quite similar in taste but different in meat. Garnished with edible flowers, both the meats were minced and deep fried till beautifully crispy and tucked into the pockets along with carrot, cucumber, hummus, spinach & butter. In case you feel the bao is dry, you get a dip alongside ( Red Thai curry sauce with the Urumqi Lamb & BBQ Black Bean sauce with the chicken ) as well as pickled carrots & cucumbers garnished with sesame.The trick to enjoying the Bao Pocket is to push the stuffing a bit inside and press on the bao pocket to slightly flatten it. You will enjoy the delicious filling till the end.Mala Pot Chicken( Rs.545 )One portion will easily fill two people quite a bit. The Mala Pot Chicken meal is served in a pot filled with butter-herb rice doused with gravy. The gravy of the Mala pot consists of soya sauce, five spice mix, dry red chillies in which are tossed boneless pieces of chicken, bamboo shoots, onion & succulent pieces of shiitake mushroom. One thing that really impressed us was that the rice was not over or undercooked. It was moist but not squishy at all..let's leave it at the rice was very well cooked.Green Tea Tiramisu( Rs.295 )Ice cream milk foam, chocolate, scooped watermelon & matcha green tea powder crowned the dessert. The layer of whisked cream was an absolute delight to have, however, coffee-infused cake below was a bit too sweet for our taste.BeveragesPineapple Chili Cooler( Rs.240 )Chilli powder & tobacco sauce added to a base of pineapple juice was what the Pineapple Cooler was all about & we LOVED it ! The juice is not too sweet and the spice skips your tongue only to give you some pleasant spicy notes after you gulp down each sip.Cucumber Wasabi Cooler ( Rs.240 )The Cucumber Wasabi cooler was a concoction of a pulpy & slushy cucumber juice teamed up with wasabi. When you sip your drink, you for a few seconds you will believe the drink is devoid of any wasabi, but we guarantee you the spice will creep up just when you don’t expect it. Let the drink rest & the ice melt for a while of the drink gets a bit tough to sip through a straw.( Please note : the quantities in the images are sample portions served to us on request for the purpose of the review. )We would like to thank Sandeep, Dan Singh Mehta, Anjan, Suraj & Rajesh Thakur for the wonderful time.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-or30-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai

I say near authentic because they have spiced up the food to make it more palatable to us Indians.But the dim sums are authentic stuff and one must try just about all varieties. Usual spread of different varieties of rice, noodles and dishes make selecting the food a tad difficult. But the staff is great help for first timers. Even for someone like I who,has been there aplenty, it can be a bit challenging because I would like to try different dishes each time.Try topping off the food with Fried Honey Noodles.

It was pan fried chicken, before this the chicken was grazed for an hour in herbs. Tender, well cooked, crisp and juicy and most importantly it was free for us to taste. They are yet to name this dish but of you want to taste you can give this reference to the chef and hope he cooks this for you.This place also has happy hours till 930 pm.

One of the cocktails turned out to have melon juice - we were told / expecting watermelon; so maybe something got 'lost in communication'.The service was average; with them forgetting one helping of the bao, and bringing it later on during the meal.Price-wise, the food was quite reasonable, but the markups on the drinks was a bit high.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-or60-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai

10,27-Apr-16,Poor poor service,"We dined here couple of hours ago for a family dinner and we're very very disappointed with the extremely slow service. Drinks and starters arrived 45 minutes after placing the order. Inspite of repeatedly requesting for our order, we were told that they had a big group party so, regular diners will have to wait patiently.Weird!! If you cannot cope. Then refuse more clients. Focus on your big party group. Bad hospitality management. It's better to have a few less clients than a many more dissatisfied clients.We have been regulars here ,but this time we were really really disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-or70-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai

50,20-Feb-16,"Good Food, Excellent service easy to find location","Visited this restaurant on an impulse as the décor outside was very presentable and welcoming. Went for dinner and this time around left it to the server to suggest and bring the dishes. Their Fire roasted Mandarin chicken and Pepper lamb for starters are something that should not be missed. They have a sign outside advertising their buffet menu with varying prices for different days of the week. We tried their ""Chocolate Tsunami"" and that too was a very well presented. Chocolate Moouse served with hot chocolate. Great combo.The staff are very attentive and provide very good service especially the manager who came around asking if everything was okay and if there was something he could do then to please call on him. Such service has now become synonymous with restaurants in India. The staff everywhere we have visited go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and welcomed. Mumbai, I am told, is a hub for some of the best restaurants that you have ever been to with best chefs across the nation and I seem to follow that line and hope to visit as many of these fine restaurants as I possibly can. This is my 4th year of consecutive visit to India and everywhere I have gone I seem to be impressed more and more. Guys keep up the good work you do and don't let the standard fall.

40,13-Jan-16,Chocolate Rolls! Yum!,"I love momos, no matter what cuisine they're served under; be it Dim Sum, Gyoza, Wontons, Potstickers, Mandu or just simple Dumplings, I can gobble them up at any hour of the day! So to satisfy my crazy momo cravings, I landed up at China Bistro on a Monday evening. We were provided a table for four almost immediately. The menu mainly comprises of Chinese cuisine (hence the name) but also includes a few options from Thai, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian and whatnot.We started off with Soup - Clear with Noodles and Lemon Coriander split in two each. The clear soup had adequately boiled vegetables but the broth lacked a little flavor. It was served steaming hot so I didn't mind. Next came the dumplings - Corn and Water Chestnut. Since the others were busy with their Chicken Basil Dumplings, I swiped the entire plate to my side. They were scrumptious with a fine coating (a bit too thin for my taste). We had also ordered the Cottage Cheese Jiang's Chilli which had a sharp flavor as opposed to the flavor of the dumplings. For mains, we had Vegetables in Mahalak Sauce. It was served on a bed of rice in a large bowl. This was my first ever one-pot-meal so I was pretty excited. It turned out to be really delicious and filling.We had decided our order for dessert even before we picked our soup since two of my friends, having visited the place before went on about how the Chocolate Rolls here are heavenly. The dish consisted of warm brownie sticks wrapped with a coating that resembled the one on spring rolls but thinner; served with a scoop of Vanilla Ice-Cream. It jumped right on the list of the best desserts I've ever had. We couldn't resist ordering a second one and got an extra scoop of ice-cream. Bonus!The staff was friendly and well-informed and the music mainly consisted of the birthday song that kept playing on repeat for a table in the corner. China Bistro is a good place for oriental lovers and I'm definitely visiting it again for the dessert, if not for anything else.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-or80-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai
10,1-Jan-16,Tortured in the name of fake buffet,"It was the 31st of December, we had reserved the restaurant for the buffet.. On going there, we were told that the buffet was only in their Garden area! When we went there, we were greeted gracefully...... BY LOTS OF MOSQUITOES!!!!! When the waiter came, he brought along with him ""Pepsi in 90 ml glasses""!! After another 20 minutes came the first dish.. Some prawns, we were 5 people n he brought 1 plate! He served around 2-3 prawns in each plate n disappeared for the next literally 15 minutes! Then this continued for the rest of the buffet, a waiter came with 1 plate every 15 minutes with 2 spoonfuls of food in each plate each time... The main course Rice and Noodles were compulsorily vegetarian!! The non veg gravy dishes were loaded with sugar! The deserts were kept OPEN inspite of the mosquitoes flying over them, so we had to avoid them completely! They will charge you extra for packaged water even in a buffet! My mom and I fell sick within 6 hours of eating all that! To add to the torture, they would play the same song on repeat mode again and again!! For all this they charged us Rs. 1200 per person! We were literally looted in quest of trying out a new place! I am never ever going there again, not even if they pay me heavily for eating their rubbish sickness causing food!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-or80-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai

40,15-Dec-15,Oriental Food with difference,"Planned a family dinner at China Bistro, Worli - after reading the great reviews. Had been to the earlier ""Mela"" at this location. Reservation is recommended and we saw the place fill up fast. We were there on a Saturday. They have valet parking - you need it at this location. The decor is not over-powering but tasteful. Liked their different ""chambers"" giving a oriental setting. The place was not cheap, but the family were happy with the tastes and portions. No pork dishes - just chicken and lamb (& seafood), so they are assured larger cliental base. Observed the menu mention that they served Jain veg. and did take care about personal food allergies. Nice touch. Overall worth the visit.

Thick, tasty, authentic and perfect. Next, as recommended by attendant Raghvan, Singapore chilli prawns. Very well cooked, soft and tasty but didn't feel chillis as the name suggested.Next, The Thai Red curry chicken with steamed rice. The quantity enough to be shared by three. The red curry had typical flavours that reminded us of our Thailand trip, real good tasty curry with finely done chicken pieces.And finally, the Chinese Darsaan- or honey noodles topped with vanilla ice cream.Overall a very good food treat - coupled with very attentive staff asking your views on each dish served - that made it a memorable dining experienceWell worth revisit to try more of their vast menu items.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-or100-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai

50,10-May-15,Thumbs up,we were a group of 9. So we tried a few starters. All were great. The firey red chicken and the pepper garlic fish deserve a mention. So does the Thai green curry. The fried rice portion we were told is enough for 4 but it isn't. It's enough for 2.No complaints about the food. The pricing is a little on the higher side side so one can't pop in there just because you don't feel like eating at home .We were seated in the private room and we had enough peace and quite but had to step out to get the captain / waiter when we needed anything.

The food is something that will please the Indian palate without really burning it with excessive spice.. As seen with most Indian Chinese restaurants. The food is fresh...tasty...good on the palate...a little bland sometimes... The ambience is good.. Staff friendly n courteous.... home delivery is phenomenally quick....In summation... A good and reasonable alternative to authentic Chinese in South Bombay...,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-or120-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai
50,10-May-14,Good Chinese Buffet..,"We visited this place for buffet for office team lunch. They serve us wide variety of starters,soup, a juice and then the main course and desserts. Must say they do a fab job. Lunch Buffet is very reasonable. Loved the food. Their non veg dimsums are yummy. Oh their service is outstanding. The staff is very welcoming and helpful.

50,28-Apr-14,Value for money in Downtown Mumbai,"Extremely courteous valets immediately took charge of the car and we were led inside by charming hostesses who offered us a seat in either the bar, the main restaurant or the small al fresco seating. We ordered a Veg Hot & Sour soup and some dim sums. The soup was tasty but it was the dim sums that stood out. Perfectly steamed, perfectly translucent & delicious! A Chinese resto that gets its dim sums right holds immense promise for the mains to come - and that promise was fulfilled. The coriander noodle hot pot was outstanding. I requested for an off-the-menu dish comprising of sautéed Chinese veggies with some chicken and the chef not only obliged but delivered exactly what I had in mind. Kudos to the kitchen staff! I asked for the manager and within minutes, a friendly and competent gentleman was at our table. One thing I must say about the China Bistro is that the service levels are great. The pricing is reasonable and portions are generous. Best time to visit is Mon - Thu for their Unlimited Buffet system where the pricing is very reasonable & to top it off with a pint of beer or in house ice teas which are complimentary. Weekend slightly more pricey.. you can be thoroughly spoilt for choices in their starters variety. This is a place I expect to be visiting often. You should too...

I have never had so many starters served at my table and you better have a good appetite if you want to go through all of these PLUS the main course PLUS the desserts!! Man, I was literally full to the point of exploding by the time I finished.Their welcome drink gives you a choice of either a peach iced tea or a fresh lime soda. I opted for the former and found it incredibly refreshing.Apparently they have a very well stocked bar and their mocktails are splendid, but I had no room left to sip on one...maybe the next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d6210285-Reviews-or120-China_Bistro-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,China Bistro, Worli, Mumbai

We started with a lovely chicken and corn soup and then followed six or seven dishes of very tasty food all purportedly cooked in a wok. Very nice and, I think, dumbed down a bit to suit a western palate although I tend to like spicier food. We also had a nice dessert.Food was plentiful and tasted nice.

20,25-Sep-18,Average place,"Used to be great few years back (before their renovation). The food used to be superb and the wok concept was new.Now, every wok tastes exactly the same. I went twice with my wife and child. Both times we tried 6-7 different works between us. And they all tasted and looked pretty similar. Wish they work on the taste and get it back to what it was.The other annoying thing is, they add a 5/- “charity” to the bill without asking. How can they do that? Without asking or anything. Had to get it removed both the times. It’s not a matter of 5/- but it’s about principles. Shameful that they would try to pull a fast one like this.Would probably still visit the place cause my son loves the concept of making your own wok.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or10-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

Quickly seated (we reached just as it opened), we ordered dumplings, stir fried noodles, water melon juice, and some stir fried veggies. We specifically asked for food to be less spicy, and it really wasn't. I almost had spit out the food because my mouth was on fire.

Liked the Basa fish starter but not the Chin Win Chicken and the Tofu Bulgogi. Again in the main course did not like the black pepper sauce chicken while the veg dishes were pretty good. Desserts were unfortunately the biggest let down with the cheesecake tasting really bad and the date pancakes tasking OK. Service was slow but very good. All in all came out with a unsatisfied outcome.Note: While Google Maps correctly shows the location, look for The Gordon House on the building itself; All Stir Fry is inside this building on the ground floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or30-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

We tried a chicken basil chili chicken from the main course. It didn't taste very good as the meat had a smell, the dish lacked seasoning. The host was very kind to replace our dish, then we ordered a paneer in hot and sour hunan sauce. That was a good dish.

This time, I thought of doing it the other way around.I tried the new sauce -- Thai BBQ -- which was quite tasty. This should be tried with red meat. Then, Hunan sauce, Korean BBQ (another interesting sauce) and Hot Bean.The trick is to take small helpings and try multiple sauces -- if you are OK with constantly going to the Wok. And if you are a rice lover, you can tell the Chef to put some rice.The service is efficient and courteous. Truly, an enjoyable place!Visited again and was pleasantly surprised to see some new sauces added to their repertoire -- 5 Spice and Korean BBQ sauce. Both were delicious !

20,29-Nov-16,Poor Show,"My experience at All Stir Fry for the past many years had been very nice. The food served there used to be really good and since i used to work in that locality i was a regular there. However, my last visit which was after a gap of nearly more that a year with some important guest turned to be a real dampner. The menu seems to have changed with the main items retained and is now more concise. For starters we had the chicken in honey and chilly served with crispy spinach. This was very well done.In main course we had ordered the Teppan noodles with chicken and Indonesian rice with prawns & chicken. This turned out to be even below average. The sauces used in both the dishes seemed the same. The noodles barely had some veggies in it and was a gooey mess. The rice too had nothing to write home about.Surprisingly the staff kept asking us on how the food was atleast 4-5 times during course of the meal. Finally the chef also came around asking for feedback, thats when we asked him what the difference in the 2 dishes were. He was stumbling for answers and when we even pointed out that the noodles barely had any veggies, he curtly responded to the waiter asking him to serve them more if they want and moved on.After this experience, i had to cut a sorry figure with my guests, but fortunately the fortune cookie was good enuf and had some witty quotes to make the mood lighter. But i would never go back again to All Stir Fry for sometime now.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or60-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

40,20-Nov-16,Lovely food..especially your customized wok,"I have been visiting this eatery for years, it's a shame that I just realized that I haven't reviewed it yet. If you're going post 8.30 pm, especially on a weekend, please make a reservation. Spacious and sparkling ambience, although the tables could be set too close to each other, and you may get an unapproving stare from a vegetarian seated close to you for devouring your meaty delights. The a-la-carte menu is impressive and the few dishes I have tried from it have been excellent no doubt, I visit this place for the customizable wok. You get to pick your choice of noodles or rice (I am so glad they have the vermicelli as well), and an array of veggies and meats (Vegetarians Note: the raw meats lurk around close by, so if you are put off by the sight/smell, I suggest you go for the a-la-carte dishes). We can then choose our sauces (my personal favourite being the chilli plum and the korean bbq) and request the wonderful chefs behind the counter to make you your own stir fry (these guys work tirelessly and I'm very appreciative of them). This wok is unlimited of course, so pace yourself, take a little at a time. Worth the money in my opinion.

I love the idea of making Unlimited Woks till you are absolutely stuffed. Very similar to Mongolian Barbeque chain in United States.You can pick up the veggies and the meat that you like and they cook the same in front of you asking you what sauce you had like - you can always ask them to add some extra condiments like Chilli Oil or crushed Pepper and the like.Last time I visited there a week back, they seem to have done away with a friendly info board in the Cooking Area informing patrons about what sauce is best paired with what kind of meats and veggies. That certainly made the dining experience more enjoyable in my opinion and encouraged people to try newer sauces. I wonder why that board disappeared and whether it is permanent or just temporary.Apart from the Wok, they do have some lovely Ala-Carte options as well. I love their Desserts, particularly the Friend Banana with Ice Cream and Honey Noodles with Ice Cream.

Some things don't change and it should be like that cuz thats what they are know for! The food, service personnel like 'Vijay' who was on our table today, truly make a restaurant. Having visited after so many years, the staff remember you, and personalise the dish or an experience for you.I had a urge for Golden fried Prawns, which I decided to have mid-way though the main course, Vijay overhead the conversation, he specially had it made for me!! These things make a difference.. These things help the restaurant to sustain for many years to come.Had a great Sunday meal, Thank you so much for the kind attention right from the valet service to the Manager who came to see on the table.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or90-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

40,20-Feb-16,"Super stylish and amusing concept, attracting young well-to-do local crowd and families","The idea of an 'eat as much as you want' stir fry buffet where you compose your own dish from a self-service counter and have it cooked in front of you in a glass box kitchen attracted us the first time. But the food made us come back! Really nice crowd of thirty-something friends eating together, quite a few table of girlfriends gossiping, children having fun choosing their meals - with different woks and implements being used for vegetarians - this is a fun place to go. Good stylish decor with a wall of woks used as light fixtures.not cheap by local standards but very kind, attentive and efficient service. Well located in Colaba near the Abode Hotel - and on the ground floor of the Gordon House Hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or90-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai
40,10-Feb-16,Perfect Sunday afternoon family lunch,"We were the first ones to arrive at 12.45 on a Sunday afternoon at the All Stir Fry restaurant. Housed in the boutique Gordon House hotel, we were greeted by a sweeping view of a high ceiling, spaciously laid out contemporary restaurant that welcomed us into its vista. A smiling crew is always a good sign. We chose the a la carte option instead of 'make your Wok' option as we did not want to stuff ourselves. But the unlimited food Wok option has great options and is worth a try if you are looking forward to a lazy Sunday snooze after a few beers and great oriental food. The menu is balanced and there are good options for all the typical oriental fare that one is used to in Mumbai. The Prawn soup was well made with fresh prawns and a mildly aromatic clear soup. The roasted chicken steamed bun was really tasty and adequately spicy. We had never tried the baked bun option earlier so we found it on the thicker side and slightly under cooked for our palate...but the chicken was amazing. The Fire Chicken with Rice lacked the Fire that we were expecting in terms of hot spices. But the Gerong noodles with chicken breast made up for it. A couple of beers went well with the food like it always does. The sizzling brownie with ice cream was a let down as the brownie was burnt through and left a bitter after taste. Portions are good and overall a good experience. Priced just right with an average of Rs. 750/head.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or90-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

40,15-Nov-15,The perfect Wok!,"Food - 4.5/5Ambience - 3.5/5Service - 4/5Value for money - 4/5Though the place serves regular starters/ main course etc as well, we chose to have the unlimited wok for dinner - one veg, one non-veg. They have separate bowls for veg and non-veg marked green and red respectively. You can choose the ingredients of your wok from an array of raw veggies, meat paired with rice/ noodles and choice of sauce and condiments. There are around 10-12 types of sauces you can choose from in the categories of mild, spicy and hot. We tried the Mongolian sauce (spicy), Spring onion ginger sauce (mild) and Black bean sauce (hot) with the veg wok and garlic pepper sauce (spicy), Trasi (hot) and sweet lemon sauce (mild) with the non-veg wok. All the sauces were very well made and having the samplers for tasting helps greatly. The chef also recommends which condiments go well with your choice of ingredients in the wok. The wok is priced at INR 730 (exclusive taxes) for both veg as well as non-veg. Though this does turn out to be a tad bit expensive given the service charge as well at 10 percent, the quality of the food makes its worthwhile. We also tried the Gordon Gypsy mocktail which was a nice concoction of lichi juice, blue curacao, coconut cream...not overly sweet. What they should probably work on is the seating..it can get pretty uncomfortable without the backrest/ backrest being too far off on some benches. Overall had an amazing experience and would come back for the wok.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or100-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

10,10-Oct-15,FISH MARKET feel with a horrible pricing,"After a bad experience we finalised to drop into this placefor dinner. Had heard alot about their Wok. Well the place is big enough well lit etc.Well checked the wok section was hardly impressed as the veggies offered were as usual and basic. No waterchestnuts No imported varities of mushroom for the PRICE THEY ASK. Its crazy to pay that much almost aeound RS800 including taxes for a person to make your own wok. For such a local and simple veggies when one can get better options at many other good joints with exotic ingredients.As my friend who had been here earlier highly recommended to try one, i made one myself and opted for garlic pepper sauce they made it too oily to eat and enjoy the wok so it was a thumbs down from my side.We ordered the Khousey this too was below average compared to other places that i have tried and relished. They add a lot of coconut milk/ cream which actually is annoying.The wrost thing was the NOISE. It feels like a FISHMARKET. Every one screaming on top of their mind to communicate. I would prefer a place calm to enjoy my company and chat. Rather than spending money on a place which has below average preparations and a fishmarket feel.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or110-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

We selected our ingredients from the counter of cut-vegetables and meats/fish put them into the bowls and took it to another hot cooking room to the chef who would stir fry it in a hot wok and serve it to you in a few minutes.Their buffet is known as WOK buffet and dinner is from 7pm to 1am.

40,5-Aug-15,Be your own chef with delicious sauces and toppings,"All Stir Fry is one of the most engaging and interesting formats of restaurants I have seen. Though there is an option of a la carte, I recommend going with the make your own bowl buffet. It gives you the option of choosing your own toppings, noodles / rice as base. You can also then choose your sauces and the in-house chef will saute and toss it and give it back to you. The sauces are classified depending on their flavours to make it easy to choose. Recommended sauces in my opinion were kung pao sauce, asian herb sauce and the hot and sweet sauce. The trick is to make small portions each time so that you can try multiple sauces and combos.

The stir fried stuff is ready within 3-4 minutes. For people who do not prefer doing the rounds of the kitchen, there is an ala-carte menu with Dimsums and curries - basically oriental cuisine and Thai cuisine.

Apart from the à la carte menu, you can choose your own ingredients from the wok and select from a long list of sauces. Although it is a bit on the expensive side, it is totally worth it, provided you know which items will tickle your tastebuds when cooked with the right sauce. The items in the wok are carefully chosen ... the vegetables are fresh, the eggs, meats, tofus and seafood are of the very best quality. Try as many combinations of ingredients and sauces as you want. The Kung pao and the Hunan sauce are my personal favourites and generally the safest ones which go with most of the ingredients.

30,29-Jun-15,repeated visits. good food. quality maintained. only service with courtesy & smile missing now....,"disliked many things - but yes first the good facts:clean yes; reaching early has its benefit; but i guess the food order from a la carte, does take quite some time. instead of the wok - we went for a la carte only.assortment orderered was good. MSG if at all present - wud be in very less qnty. (no chinese food restaurant wud serve its food without MSG).Disliked:However, i noticed that our servers lacked the courtesy, the humbleness to serve food was totally missing at this place.... infact the door man at the restaurant/hotel entrance was far far more humble - welcoming - smiling & courteous, even when we left.in fact - when our food was being served - the server was least bothered about announcing the dish being served & whether the patron wants it or not.... he stood straight like a tree, serving the food over the arms & hardly was happy about his job it seems!!!Bombay - this city is slowly getting down in its ""atithi devo bhava"" approach.I felt i was obliged by both of them that they are giving us to eat... NO PLEASE -If it werent for the kids, i wud have been very vocal about such attitude esp when serving food - forget anything else.FOOD is GOOD!! Vegetarian options are many!!!DISLIKED: forced to shell out (no matter the amount) additonal money in the name of education school that this company wud be supporting....!!!

50,26-Jun-15,Superb Concept - A Must Visit for Asian Food Lovers,"Have been planning to visit this place for sometime, finally made itlast month.Must say that this is 'some place else'. Its a very attractive option for foodies, provided you know how to practise 'calibrated eating'.Some tips for the first timers:1) Visit the place on a weekday, its practially empty and you can have the live kitchen all to yourself and spend a lot of time with the chefs whipping up whatever you want. Weekends are crowded and the small live kitchen has enough place only for a few people to stand (as its a glass enclosed area) and you would have a line extending till the food stand outside the kitchen.2) Resist the urge to load your plate with everything you see in the first trip to the kitchen, keep the plate light, try out the various sauces and various dishes, ask the chefs for their recommendations and space out your innings. For the non vegetrations - try out a few squids in the Thai Barbecue sauce, try some prawns in another sauce, try a chilly chicken or a chicken in mongolian sauce, try the fried rice, noodles and so on, its really a great value for money joint if you eat right, else you will feel stuffed and will end up not getting the bang for your buckCar Parking is an issue on weekends, so again I prefer a week night to visit All Stir Fry. The place is tucked into a small lane opposite Lings Pavilion, you can also access it from the parallel road that has 'The Table'.All in all a great place.The only thing I did not like are the seats, could have had some more comfortable seating.They have a couple of baby chairs for those of you who have little ones with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or130-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

40,21-May-15,Different experience for a family dining,"The place offers an unusual experience with its over the counter wok. The diner gets to choose his ingredients and the type of sauce for his wok. It is an amusing experience especially for kids. The seating is very casual. The service is good. It is slightly overpriced considering the wok per person costs you Rs 1,000. For anybody who does not wish to experiment a lot with his food, there is the conventional ala carte option available.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or130-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

40,12-May-15,Great DIY meal options,"We went here on a Friday night in a group of four. There wasn't too much of a rush and we got a table immediately.We went for the buffet where you get to load up your bowl and they cook it in a sauce of your choice. I picked noodles with toppings of spring onions, mushrooms, corn, paneer and some random herbs. I had it cooked in the Kung Pao sauce.The cooking area is in a bit of a corner, leading to an uncomfortable waiting experience. You don't want to be bumping into a bunch of people with a bowl full of steaming hot noodles. Anyways, that apart, the food was excellent. You can have as many bowls as you like by I doubt most people get past a bowl and a half.The buffet is priced assuming you will have six of them I think, I found to slightly pricey at 750 bucks a pop. Overall a decent experience though, would love to come back here.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or140-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

30,20-Apr-15,Can do much better!,"If you are a veggie and planning to visit this place, you must atleast read the next 3 paras.I had heard a lot of good reviews about this place and some friends strongly recommended me to try it.We ordered the ""crackling spinach"" for a veggie friend and they served ""crackling chicken"" instead. They served it in a hurry and she ended up eating a small portion of the chicken dish. This was a big blunder on the part of the restaurant. Not at all expected from such a reputed restaurant known for its good food and reviews. We were discounted a part of the bill but this doesnt compensate for what she went through after that.Some tips for the All stir fry team since you read these reviews regularly and for the sake of other customers/loyal patrons who visit your restaurant:1. Have separate coloured plates for vegetarians and non vegetarians similar to what you do for your wok bowls.2. Ask your waiters to be a little loud when they serve and not serve in a hurry. Customers come to your restaurant to enjoy a good experience.We also tried the chicken clear soup, pan fried fish and the chilli potatoes. All the 3 dishes were well prepared. You cant miss the pan fried fish. The wok (both veg and non veg) were very good. Dessert was pan fried honey noodles with ice cream which was ok.Overall, I was expecting lots of things from this place but one incident at the beginning left a bad first impression. Food quality is good, ambience is decent. There is a lot of road construction work going on there now so you must find it hard to get parking place.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or140-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

50,25-Feb-15,Wok style!!!,"I have been visiting this place since 2006 and this is one of my favourite restaurants in town. The wok style cooking pan asian style is an amazing concept. Many other restaurants have now introduced the same - but I think All Stir Fry was the pioneer!! It is a place where you select all the ingredients that you want from the proteins, greens, add ons, take it to the woks, instruct the chefs to add the condiments and sauces that you want and eat away..you can make as many trips to the counter and wok as you can eat!! It is a lovely place to chill with friends and family or even take business clients to. The only downside that I see here is the lack of variety on the menu if someone does not want the wok.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or150-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

20,11-Oct-14,Gawd....its awful..!!!,"Trust me. You drag yourself from central suburbs to reach Gordon house. Wait for 20 minutes to get a table. And then the experience you get is sufficient to convince you never to come back here. This place is pretty highly rated by most. I won't dispute what others say. But my honest opinion is as follows.Service : Don't expect any as you literally have to wave at servers to get their attention.Ambiance : Decent. But the acoustics of the hall make is so noisy that it feels you are trapped in a room full of 500 chatter-boxes. Enough noise to put you off.Food : We went a la carte. Ordered soups, crispy vegetables, dimsum, papaya salad, and two fixed portions recommended by the waiter. The dinner concluded with complimentary fortune cookies. Barring the soup ( And whiskeys, which came straight from the bottle ), only other edible thing were the fortune cookies. Starters and main course, was a crying shame.The waiter persuaded us to order for desserts, but we escaped post settling of the bill. I am sure their desserts would have been killer. One of us would surely have died...So, I have done my tour of duty.Helpful tip...If you do visit this place, and do find the food awful, go to Baskin Robbins ( 59 ft. away ) and drown your sorrow in some amazing ice cream sundaes.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or160-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

50,9-Mar-14,A good Asian restaurant,Introduction: The restaurant is part of the Gordon House hotel in Colaba. I recently went for a meal with my wife as a casual dinner. I have visited this place over 4 times and love coming here.Décor: The place is nicely made with wooden benches as seats as well as high chairs & tables. The place is well lit up and welcoming.Ambience: The tables are too close to each other and hence feel like once big community hall. It becomes really noisy when there are kids running around.Food: The food is mainly asian. It has unique concept of make your own wok as well as an a la carte menu. You can order a wok and they give you a bowl. Next there is an open bar with different noodles and vegetables where you pick whatever you like into the bowl. Next you enter their open kitchen and choose the sauce you like. This is given to the chef who shall make it as per your liking. You could do this as many times you want. They replace the bowl for every new preparation. The food is really good and tasty. The have a wide variety of ingredients and sauces to try out. The mocktails they serve are good too however a bit overpriced.Service: The service is usually quick and efficient unless you visit on weekends for lunch when it can get really crowded and waiting in a queue for the wok can get a bit frustrating.Pricing: The pricing is average with a meal for two costing about Rs. 1500 without alcohol.Overall: I love the place as it gives each one the individual preference to have the wok prepared they way you like it.

It's unlimited. The chefs are very helpful if you are not aware of which sauce(s) to use. You just tell them what is preference. The service is prompt. And the fortune cookies they serve are to die for.

Its a sprawling huge place when I went there first - not too sure if after renovation, it has changed interiors or not (heard it was shut recently for the same). The wok style eating quite excited everyone. So what you do is, take your wok and choose your kind of veggies, meats and sauces and have the cook make it for you right in front of everyone.. Fun, fun and yum, yum! Others on my table had the Thai Papaya Salad, the Tom Kha Je soup, the Crispy Tofu with Chilli and Pepper Corn side dish and the Indonesian Grilled Chicken.

20,18-Jul-13,Ordinary...,"Great concept but poorly executed. Also, two of our group ended up with bad tummies. The meats, seafood and vegetables had probably been lying in their containers for a while and the squid in particular was definately off. The sauces were disappointing and tasted similar and despite my request for very little sauce my dish was drenched in some horrible brown curry-like preparation. Disgusting for a discerning eater. The other stuff we ordered off the menu was better -- Dim Sum and Satay and a really nice Crab and Asparagus Soup. All in all very average but the place was full on a week night so obviously there is a market for this sort of food. Not cheap though. A meal for five with two drinks and no desserts cost Rs 6500.

40,21-Jun-13,Interesting experience,"Visited on a colleague's recommendation. All of us enjoyed the concept and novelty of creating our own meals. I would only suggest that there be more variety in veggie sauces. I tried sweet chili, Asian herbs and garlic veg but didn't quite like the taste of any. They were either too spicy or too tangy. Maybe something more conventional Chinese like sweet and sour or manchurian sauce would be a welcome addition. I'm not sure i understand the taste of thai sauces!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or190-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

30,7-May-13,Gr8 concept... can be better,"This is the similar concept as the Big Bowl in the USA. The concept is really nice where you can pick your choice of veggies, meat, noodles, etc in the bowl given to you and hand it over to the chef who mixes it with your choice of sauce in a wok. The result is your choice of ingredients stir fried to your taste. I also would like to mention that the sauces are displayed so you can taste them all and select. I feel that there could be more options for the veggies, meat, etc. After the first mix where you have selected your favorites, you don't feel like selecting the same for the second time. Also I was not happy with the quality of sauces. There can be more suggestions as what veggies/meat would go best with what sauce which makes it easier. I chose to go with the sauce suggested by the chef and was quite unhappy with the taste. Overall a nice concept and you have to be really hungry to fill your bowl for more than two times to match the cost you are paying.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or190-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

You can eat as much as you like and the taste is completely in your hands as you select the veggies, meat, sauces, and rice/noodles. The problem is the crowd and the time you have spend to get your food cooked. The kitchen area is very unclean and had a pool and stream of water flowing. You have to go to the kitchen area without choice because the food is cooked for you in front of you. For an expensive place, that looked too unhygienic.

20,20-Aug-12,"Food strictly okay, service strictly nonsense, attitude abysmal","My visit to All Stir Fry confirmed by belief that it is just hyped up for no rhyme or reason. Located in Colaba is basically the only claim to fame for this restaurant in my view. Despite making reservation, we waited for 20 minutes while several (yes more than 3) tables stayed empty in front of us - the manager behaved as if he was expecting royalty to come and have a dinner there. The food was strictly okay - frankly i've had better at the unheralded China Valley in Powai which is much better (by miles actually). Service was bad - with few active waiters, the table next to us wasn't cleaned the entire duration of our meal. The manager was pretty rude and kept dialing something on the landline and his cellphone to appear as if he was busy and avoid all eye contact. No basic courtesy while leaving as well. Just as well, it will be my first and last visit to this place, and i would highly reccomend patrons heading somewhere else to have a good time (Delhi Durbar just down the road has brilliant non-veg if you are not crazy for Chinese)",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or210-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai

On multiple visits I experimented with various options and have been extremely satisfied with the experience.Another advantage in choosing All Stir Fry is the location. It is located at Colaba close to important business centers and hence is just a short cab ride away. Perfect for a business lunch.The only downside I can point out is the large screen tv which used to be a distraction. Similarly the restaurant should target improving their A-la-carte menu. Some of my associates have had trouble getting what they wanted if they did not try the main buffet.To sum it up, All Stir Fry is one great restaurant.

It is located on ground floor of Gorden house hotel, behind regal cinema, close to famous mondegar and leopold Cafe.The setting is nice, but they do not have licence to service alcohol, they only get you beer from somewhere. that is very sad. Pune has a full fledged bar.However, the kitchen here is nicely segregated with automatic doors, which ensures that the strong and pungent smell does not go out to the diners.The good part about the restaurant is that they have some sauses kept for tasting before you can order your sause with the wok.The wok has a wide variety.

30,21-Feb-12,Interesting,"A DIY stir fry concept, you choose the ingredients, then choose the sauces and garnishes and they stir fry it for you.Not bad idea, but watch out some of the sauces are too hot for comfort.They don't have a liquor license (strange), so you cant have a glass of wine or a beer with dinner.Was fun, but wont go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d785384-Reviews-or210-All_Stir_Fry-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,All Stir Fry, Colaba, Mumbai
30,12-Feb-12,"Good Food, Different Concept, Poorly Managed","Located at one of the most happening locations in Mumbai, All Stir Fry is always a happening place. The concept: Select the veggies and meat, noodles/rice, take it in a bowl, and ask the cook at the live counter to prepare the dish in a sauce of your choice. They charge INR 525 per person (taxes extra). Unlimited food on offer; however, drinks (non-alcoholic) at an extra charge. It is good to select the stuff of your choice and get it cooked fresh. They have some 15 varieties of sauces too. Quite an interesting place. Now the flip side, as people have to go to the live counter to get there preparations it can get messy. No person is bothered to manage the queue. Also, at the live counter, there was a pool of water on the floor too. Pretty shoddy. Other than this bit, it is worth visiting.

You pick your veggies, and your meats and you go to the kitchen where they cook it for you. I have always found the food to be very fresh especially the meats and the fish that you pick raw. The place is spotless and the food is very well cooked. Everytime I go here, the choice of cooking styles is more than the last time. You can be a bit experimental and they will cook it as you like it. Once you have gone through the experience once, you can go through it again in the same night as the wok is unlimited. An excellent way to have an informal N course meal!Ambience:Very lively, lots of groups and always full. Lovely decor and just off colaba causeway.Choice:Huge menu! But I only go here for the wok. Maybe some day, I'll go a la carte and write about it.Service:Excellent service. Non intrusive, yet efficient.Overall:Great for individuals with a huge apetite and experimental in nature! :-) Make reservations and take your time with the wok.

50,1-Nov-11,A once a month visit is mandatory for me,"All Stir Fry (ASF) has been an all time favourite for many years now and one was wondering when it went under renovation if the hotel would come up with a fancy, expensive exotic cuisine restaurant. But thank god, what reopened was ASF.One has gone there a number of times and the service has always been outstanding. The food quality is excellent and though normally one goes for the Wok, the Dim sums and other al a carte dishes are fabulous as well.The seating is on wooden benches and hence a bit uncomfortable. Also they have had some problem with a liquor license in the new Avatar and hence don't serve any.One tip for people going for the first time for a Wok.

40,21-Apr-19,Good Food But Poor Ambience,"Let me start off with the negative and get that out of the way. Much work needs to be done on the facade and the interiors of the restaurant. When I entered and saw the place I wanted to turn right out and walk away. Fortunately I was convinced to stay on by those who were with me as they had previously eaten well here. I then believed that due to the very mediocre decor, the prices would also 'match'. But no such thing. The prices match those of any other very well appointed restaurant, and this paradox is a huge negative in my mind. If you are charging as much as any other good restaurant ,you must not look and feel like a tacky substandard Chinese restaurant.Having said this, I must rush to add that the food is good, and the service pleasing (thank you fredricka). The sushi platter though underwhelming was nothing to complain about, but the rice bowl, crispy lotus stems, Schezwan fish, and chilli chicken were definitely enjoyable. All in all it was a good evening but I don't think I'd return there in a hurry. If Trip Advisor had a three and half star rating possible, that is what I would consider as most appropriate for this restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or10-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

40,23-Sep-18,Refreshing new menu for Asian food lovers,"Bandra’s much-loved casual dining restaurant Mamagoto has been serving delightful Pan Asian food for years, and has now come out with a new menu that’s a tad more experimental and fun.Mamagoto has been my go-to place for family dinners and dates alike, with its quirky, colourful ambiance and fun Asian menu. There’s sushi and dim sum and those famous lettuce wraps to go with the drinks, and hearty bowls and curries for mains. Now this new menu is an addition to the classic menu and is inspired by Delhi’s Mr Mamagoto. There are interesting new small plates, soups and salads, cocktails, and mains to choose from. They’ve also redone the décor, with signature Mama-style paintings on the walls and comfy seating for big and small groups.Coming back to the food, I’ve always loved that Mamagoto’s menu is so different from the usual Pan Asian fare available elsewhere in Mumbai.Try the Lotus Root Tempura that’s tempered with curry leaves and served in a curry-flavoured sauce, or the Shrimp with Wasabi Cream or the Japan Hiker’s Salad. I also recommend the Hoisin Chicken Bao with soft, pillowy baos made in-house, and deliciously spiced pieces of chicken.Love dumplings? The new menu has a good selection that’s also pretty unique, such as the Kowloon Spicy Chicken Dumpling and Kohima Street Wontons (veg/chicken). The use of peanuts and chilli gives it a nice crunch and nutty flavour profile. They also do Maki Rolls but I suggest you call for the dumplings and baos instead.If you, like me, are constantly dilly-dallying between being on a strict diet and wolfing good food, you’ll be happy to know that Mama’s got it sorted. The mains are a mix of healthy and tasty. One dish that stood out for me in this respect, was the Hainan Chicken Rice – poached chicken with pak choi and steamed rice that you can mix up this soulful broth that’s chock full of flavour. Add a dash of their Singaporean chilli sauce to take it to the next level!I also enjoyed the oh-so-crispy Chicken Katsu served with a traditional Japanese sauce and soba noodles.Some of the other new additions that sounded yum were the Indonesian Potato and Chickpea Curry, and the Asian Tofu and Chips with coconut-infused mashed peas and potato wedges.This new menu also has a commendable list of cocktails, again, with crazy, unpredictable concoctions. I highly recommend the Majestic Sour, a tall copper glass full of bourbon, saffron syrup, egg white, lime and bitters. Whether you’re a whiskey lover or not, you won’t be disappointed.Another whiskey-based cocktail What a Matcha, served in a cutesy teacup, is not too strong on matcha flavour (otherwise it would be too bitter) but still tastes refreshing with its ginger and citrus notes.I didn’t try the vodka and honeydew melon-based Jockey Club Lunch but hey, here’s a reason to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or30-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
50,10-Sep-18,Must visit n try the new menu,"Mamagoto-My Recommendations-• Pop (cocktail)• Chicken Liver Pate(small Plates)• Prawn Sushi Stack (Maki n family)• Prawns Har Gao (Dumpling)• Caramel Sponge cake(Dessert)Location- Restaurant is located on one of the busiest road of Mumbai that is on hill road of bandra. Big restaurants like this can’t have better locations than this for sure.(5/5)Theme- Recently restaurant has updated their menu in which they have added more of a European touch with Asian food. Concept is more like casual dining restaurant with Asian/European food.(4.5/5)Look and Feel- Restaurant has positive vibes as soon as you enter inside. Dining area is really huge and divided into 3-4 small parts. Bar counter is at the end of the restaurant which was little surprising for me. Bar should be more decorated I feel. Seating is extremely comfortable. Lighting was just perfect I felt, neither very dark nor very bright. Wall got impressive work on it.(4.5/5)Service/staff- Staff was really supportive and always ready to help. Suggestions at each category was very nice from them. Service was little slow at the beginning but later it was perfectly smooth.(5/5)Food and Beverage-The restaurant is almost more than 4 years so I am sure they have produced many delicious products. Now they have come up with new menu which we tried rather enjoyed. Menu is little shifted from Asian food to European food but some of the asian flavours are intact. Menu is sorted I felt got few starters, salads, dimsums, baos, main courses, cocktails etc. Cocktails had few Asian touch to it. Menu with limited products is best I feel. Each dish we ordered had distinct flavours/taste. Portion size was just perfect. They got few of the amazing Maki options in the menu. Food and beverage were really class apart.(5/5)Beverages-• POP(Cocktail)- Tea based cocktail made with popcorn flavoured syrup, vodka and citrus juice. It was really very smooth in taste with little smoky touch of pocorn. Served with few pieces of popcorns which gave added value. Strongly recommended drink for sure.(5/5)• BRIXTON SMASH(Cocktail)- A vodka based drink made with white grapes, basil, mint, elderflower syrup. Nice and different drink. Had freshness of mint and sweetness of elderflower. (4.5/5)Food-• SHRIMP N WASABI CREAM(Small plates)- shrimps tossed in caramelised onions, wasabi cream and served along with crisp lavash kind of bread which was sprinkled with spice powder. Shrimps tasted extremely wow, perfect dish with your cocktails I must say. Shrimps had little pungent but creamy taste, after effect of wasabi was just perfect.(5/5)• CHICKEN LIVER PATE(Small plates)- Chicken liver pate garnished with fried crispy onions and served along with pickled veg and sriracha sauce. Live pate was really really impressive, remembered my days when I use to make it taj London. Melting in mouth with creamy texture, offcourse heavy for stomach this pate was one of the best I had in long long time. Crispy fried onions served with it along with prune and apricot chutney on the top of pate tasted so perfect with sweetish taste. Sriracha was perfect to cut the sweetness.(5/5)• SALMON ROLL N SPICY TUNA ROLL (Maki n family)- A perfect dish for sushi lovers. Tuna was little spicy and crisp once we bite it. Salmon was best as always. Guess these are their best maki. Must order it.(5/5)• PRAWNS SUSHU STACK(Maki n family)- sushi rice topped with mix vegetables, fried shrimps, fish eggs, micro green and sushi sheet.it was served along with the wasabi and pickled ginger. Enjoyed the dish, vegetables were mixed with wasabi mayo.(4.5/5)• PRAWN HAR GAO (Dumpling)- Cantonese style dumplings served which has shrimp paste. I don’t think so anyone should miss this if you are a dumpling fan.(4.5/5)• HERBED GRILLED FISH (Large Plates)- Fish marinated lightly and grilled which was served along with pink peppercorns and red chilli paste, black fungus mushrooms and lemon butter sauce. Loved the combination of the dish but would have preferred little portion of starch in it like fries, potato mash or anything.(4.5/5)• MISO GLAZED FISH(Large Plates)- Salmon fillet marinated in miso seasoning(Japanese seasoning) and served along with green peas and snow beans. Size of salmon fillet was really huge, but salmon was little over cooked so might be resulting in dry taste. Would have preferred some sauce and starch along with it. Somehow mismatch for me.(3.5/5)• CARAMEL SPONGE CAKE (Dessert)- caramel sponge cake served along with the warm toffee sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Sponge was really soft, totally enjoyed it.(5/5)To sum up- Changes are very important in life and especially in hotel industry. The menu menu of mamagoto is really nice and sorted I feel. Limited but best options they serving. There is a dish for each one I felt. They coming up with more restaurants in Mumbai which is really a great news I feel. Price point is very good, not very expensive too. This was my first visit to them and now I am sure I will be one of the most regular guest of this brand. Strongly recommended, must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or30-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

40,1-Sep-18,Good Asian cuisine with vibrant ambiance,"Mamagoto is a name which has been associated with some lip-smacking food, lovely ambiance and some excellent personal service. They have recently launched a newly curated menu called “Mr. Mamagoto” which is inspired by the street food across various Asian & South East Asian countries. I was invited by the management to review their same.The moment you enter through the main door, you are bombarded with an array of colors everywhere, on the left-hand side are square shaped painted wooden blocks which are arranged in a linear manner, strung in a wire, one over the other and forming an abstract design; these blocks form a partition between the outer dining area and the dining area near the bar. The wall opposite the entrance is a collage of all things that originate in Japan. There is another painting which denotes a woman holding onto a fortune cookie. There are black & white photo frames near the bar counter which date back to an era gone by. The furniture and the décor is nice mix of rustic & contemporary. The lighting is ambient.The service is noteworthy. The staff was literally on their literally for the entire duration, not only with us but with other patrons as well. The restaurant manager came over a couple of times and had a word with us, had a small talk of various topics ranging from food to footfalls and profitability. The waiting staff was equally enthusiastic and eager to feed us as much as they could.We started our meal with a MISO SOUP [INR 249] which was a nice mild spicy soup made from fermented black bean paste which is poured over 3 cubes of soft tofu, scallions, and wakame; a type of seaweed. The soup tasted nice and refreshing.We moved on to the Small Plates section from where we ordered the SWEET POTATO & OYSTER MUSHROOM [INR 399]. Boiled and peeled roundels of sweet potatoes were served on a wooden skewer, with alternate pieces of Oyster Mushrooms. It was served with charred spicy green chilies, pistachio sauce, and some boiled peanuts. The charred green chilies gave a spicy twist to remaining sweet components. We then tried the LOTUS ROOT TEMPURA [INR 399], this again was one of the best tempura I have ever had. The lotus roots were nicely fried and totally non-oily and were served garnished with fried curry leaves & red chilies.We had a JAPAN HIKER’S SALAD [INR 419] which was soba noodles tossed with long thin slices of carrot & zucchini, tossed in soy sauce and topped with a slab of tofu which was seared and cut linearly.We then turned our focus towards the Dumpling section. We tried the TURNIP CAKE [INR 449] which was a soft yet crunchy cake made from turnip bulbs and garnished with roasted garlic & red chilies. We tried the steamed dumplings; HOT VEG DUMPLING [INR 449] a thin rice sheet which an assortment of vegetables like turnip, shitake mushrooms, carrots, peanuts and a hint of spice. The VEG IMPERIAL DUMPLING [INR 449] was the same as the Hot Veg dumpling except the spices used. We then tried the KOHIMA STREET VEG WONTON [INR 449] which was a fried but non-greasy wonton stuffed with lemongrass, basil & spring onion, served with a honey chili sauce.Small portions of all the above dishes had almost filled us up, we, therefore, decided to try only one large plate dish and as recommended by the waiting staff, we went in for the INDONESIAN POTATO & CHICKPEAS CURRY [INR 499]. The suggestion was spot-on and boy-o-boy were we delighted or what! The flavors were very Indonesian with the use of peanut, yellow chili, galangal & kaffir lime and cooked in coconut milk gave it a very creamy texture. It combined very well with a flaky but very crispy Kerala Parotha.To wash down the entire meal, I asked for a HIMALAYAN SLEEPING BEAR, which was a green tea infused with chamomile flowers, fennel seeds & mint leaves. This tea took away the lethargy that had built after consuming a hefty meal and also acted as a palate cleanser.Our meal at Mamagoto was a memorable experience with respect to the food, service, ambiance & the overall feeling.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or30-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

40,25-Aug-18,New Menu Do Try,"Mamagoto Hill Road - Been 6 years now. Have been a frequent visitor here. They have revamped the place. Decor and Interiors. My first look - personally thought it could have been more litted. As far as the service and hospitality, No complaints. New Menu which sounds interesting. A mix of MR Mamagoto (Delhi) and the hot selling dishes. Curated well. Here is what we had:Salads: Wasabi Infused Smoked Chicken salad. Sorry but no trace of Wasabi (a miss here) however the mixed greens were fresh. Smoked chicken had a lovely glaze/Sheen to it. Have the smokiness needed. Overall refreshing and a good start to the evening.Dim Sums: Prawn Har GAO - nice stuffing. Minced prawns. Good balance of spices. However the layer could have been a bit thinner. Kowloon Spicy Chicken Dumpling - perfect in taste texture and balanced well. There was one more (can't remember) it was good.Sushi: Wow. Made well. Specially the vegetarian. A twist here. Green Apple and Avocado. This was interesting. Good combination of subtle/sweet/cream. Madewell. Compact and light. Smoked cheese and vegetable Maki was good. Balanced well. Nice taste (smokiness) normally we don't associate with sushi with smoke cheese. Avocado/cream. Topped with a hint of mayo. Both the veg were good.Non Veg Sushi - Salmon Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll - both stood out. Nicely balanced in terms of ingredients used topped with Spicy mayo/black and white sesame. Go for this.Baos - never associated Mamagoto with Baos. This was a great Bao made by the chef. Chickpeas & mushroom stuffed patty (gave a falafel look) texture was fantastic. Crunchy. Tasted awesome. A hint of truffle enhanced the dish. Bao made fresh was icing on the cake. For me a lovely dish. Light/fresh/healthy.Since we were having a cocktail wanted to try small plate which went with it. Asked for LOTUS ROOT TEMPURA (dish of the day) amazing. Just what was needed. Packed with flavours crunchy and perfect. Fried to perfection with a curry pata flavour (takes you to south) Flavoured sauce (cheesy mustard kind off) elevated the dish. Bird's eye chilli went well. Overall wow.Mains: Rendang Kerala Curry with Paratha. This was surprising. Being a Pan Asian restaurant. Trust me the moment it came wow. Texture perfect. Good sheen. Bold flavours. Balance of spices perfect. Coconut and a bit of kaffir lime and galangal. Made Indonesian style. Loved the Paratha as well. Fluffy and light. Perfect combination.Herbed Grilled Fish: Interesting. River Sole used here (European) Here the chef has made River soul /Pink peppercorn and Black Fungus mushrooms the key elements. All the 3 given justice. Fish pan seared well topped with Pink peppercorn jus (gives that spicy touch) along with red chilli paste. Black Fungus served in the side. Tricky yet made well. Topped with a bit of microgreens. A meal by itself.Dessert: The best I have had. HOMEMADE ""AMERICAN STYLE"" Chunky Caramel Sponge cake and wow, this was fantastic. Polished in a minute. Fresh/hot with toffee sauce served with vanilla ice cream. First time we did not touch the ice cream. Anytime for this and I will surely be back.Overall - all went well. Just a small tweak with the layers of Dimsums. We had 2 cocktails (signature) Nice job and credit to the bar tender. Worth a visit.

40,4-Jan-18,Great value for money and excellent service,"Visited Mamagoto for a family lunch. The food was superb and the service on point. Like any Mumbai restaurant, parking is always an issue. The restaurant has a small indent in the road near its entrance which allows you to stop and get off. This is especially useful on Hill Road, Bandra which is always busy.On the downside there is no wheel chair access and although it is a ground floor restaurant, there are a could of steps to get in. The venue would be better served to have some form of makeshift ramp. Overall, highly recommended if you like asian fusion food. The restaurant also offered us four complimentary mocktails which were very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or50-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

40,29-Jun-17,A place to enjoy pan-Asian cuisine,"Mamagoto is a nice place to savor the original cuisine of Asia. Food menu is elaborate but it will be better if there are options of various other noodles. Here, I would like to emphasize that Mamagoto@Bandra needs to seriously look into the quality issues of food served (as we are having stomach troubles since eating at this place yesterday), e.g. we had ordered chocolate brown fudge for dessert BUT it was not properly baked and seemed to be prepared quite a few days back thus not fresh. We really enjoyed their goat cheese tacos & chilly potato.There is a small bar also in an area of restaurant & is nicely stocked with different liquors & beverages.Service is good by general standards & staff is cooperative. Ambience of this restaurant is nice & welcoming. Putting it succinctly, Mamagoto can be a good place for one to savor tasty Asian cuisine and hang out with family or friends also.I feel, though, that these guys must work on to have better sound options in restaurant to make one's dining experience cheerful & memorable.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or60-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

20,15-Apr-17,Pathetic,"Walked in for dinner here on a Saturday night. Was surprised to see the restaurant fill up with people quite suddenly.Anyway. A large family was sent to the table next to ours. Or should i say literally ours!! One chair was almost on our table and it completely ruined our meal. The people at the table just kept looking at us and hoping we would leave soon. Was shocked to see the manager arrange this himself. To add to that, while my wife went to the rest room, a waiter comes and takes her chair away saying they need a chair elsewhere! What a pity !! Even bhurji ealas don't behave like this. Even they're more welcoming. And for the prices of the dishes at Mamagoto, they really need to train their staff..",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or70-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
30,25-Mar-17,Good food but still average (read review),"May 28 dinner: Post 8 pm, Mamagoto doesn't take reservations and hence we waited for 30 mins before we got our table. The place has bare walls and somehow, we felt that this was place seemed like an underground place. Within minutes of sitting, there were no power as they had some issue with maintenance. By then, we had ordered the beers. It was a good 15-20 minutes before the power was restored. Corona and Hoegaarden beers at 549 bucks is on the higher side. KF is at 189 bucks - so the choice was clear though after a couple of rounds, we had the Hoegaarden and Tsingtao. To start with food, had the tom yum chicken soup - yummy, crispy chilli potato - good but not as chilli as expected and the chicekn robata grill platter - nice. For the kids, the chicken fried rice was cooked well and tasted good. For the mains, had the spicy bangkok bowl and chiang mai train staion noodles with chicken. The mains tasted good but at 600 bucks a dish - pricing is on the higher side. While, we enjoyed the food, it was costly and service could have been better. Many a times, we had to call multiple times before we were attended. Also, it would have been a nice if the management would have made a gesture to make the experience better for the patrons who were seated even when there was no electricty. We could have walked out and gone to another place when the electricity went off. But we didn't. Half a star less for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or70-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

40,21-Dec-16,Families's and Friends' Fav,"Quite surprised that we haven't rated this one as yet since we have been frequenting this place with our families and friends ever since it has opened. Mamagoto (especially this one) falls under the category of our Families' favorites. Have tried other Mamagotos but they do not come closer to the charm and food this outlet dishes out.Over a period of time we have been loyal to, especially the starters such as Honey Chicken, Traditional Crispy Lamb, Crispy Lotus Stem and Chicken Satay(which we ordered this time as well), which we love, as usual. From the mains we always order Stir Fried Water Chestnut to go with Burnt Garlic Veg Fried Rice. It's always been yum. The other mains, which we ordered this time was London China Town Prawn and Chicken Masaman Curry. London China Town Prawns were fabulous with delicate flavors of spice compared to the usual, over-the-top flavoring in south-eastern cuisine. We were a bit disappointed by the Masaman Curry. Though the chicken was nicely cooked and flavored, gravy turned out to be more sweet than usual. This was even after we requested our attendant to request the chef to not add sugar or honey to the gravy as we were fine with the sweetness of coconut milk only. Nevertheless, we were able to finish it with our burnt Garlic Veg Fried Rice.We are currently quite loyal to Orange and Passion Fruit Sangria, Pomegranate Martini, Passion Fruit Mojito, Watermelon Vodka Martini, (Virgin) Cucumber Mint, Cranberry and Kaffir Lime Punch and Jasmine tea. They have wowed us as usual.From desserts our current favorite is the Banofee Pie and Gooey Chocolate cake since they are always short of Coconut and Palm Sugar Ice Cream (it's sinful, trust me)Service is perfect, Pricing is perfect and so are the portions.Just one complain, Please make more of Coconut and Palm Sugar Ice Cream....its been a while (almost a year) that we keep getting the same ""it's out of stock"" reply.

30,31-Oct-16,Expect the unexpected,"Mamagoto surprises you on many levels. For starters, the place literally means ""play with your food"" a Japanese term to encourage children to appreciate the taste, texture, etc of food. Well eating here is no child's play- the portions are unexpectedly huge. One needs to hunker down to do justice to the food quantity and that's no child's play! Despite this pan-Asian restaurant deriving its name from Japanese roots, Japanese dishes are conspicuous by their absence barring a slight semantic nod to tempura. The dishes are predominantly Chinese and Thai in origin. Though the restaurant devotes an entire section of the menu to signature rice/ noodle bowls (complete meals enough for two people), the real gem is tucked away in the starter plate section - the Vegetable Basil Cups. Its a light preparation- an assortment of veggies served in lettuce cups. We repeated the order. The oriental clear chicken soup was good. The prawn tempura was passable. The crispy lotus stem starter was a tad salty though it was served crisp as promised. The shrimp was conspicuous by its absence in the fiery Thai shrimp fried rice with Asian green chilli though there was lots of strips of fried chicken and a fried egg. The stir fried udon noodles vegetables was so-so. To sum up the starters we ordered were better than the main dishes recommended by our steward. Coming to the service- a girl named Sucheta in an ill fitting hat introduced herself as our hostess for the evening, handed out the menus and promptly disappeared, not to be seen again. We hailed the steward in a suit (head waiter?) from the adjoining table after waiting for a bit. He said he would take care of our orders. He was polite and helpful and the service progressed smoothly thereafter. Coming to the bill - it was exorbitant to put it mildly. We were 4 adults and a 4-year old and the final tally came up to 5000+ with three pints, a breezer and the dishes described above. Fine dining rates in a place with grungy decor in a inner lane of an upmarket area which is a little difficult to find.

40,20-Oct-16,Bandra location - Cramped space and average service for a high end restaurant,my husbands friends and family get together at mamagoto bandra area. We had some tuff time locating the venue as it was first time for all of us. The Bandra location needs a very keen eye to locate as you have a chance of missing it next to holy family hospital and in corner next to C’est la Vie. Even with a table reservation the service was delayed with confusion. But the food was awesome. i liked the thai basil fired rice the best. We finished lunch with their homemade yummy chocolate cake.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or90-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

40,27-Sep-16,Great meal.,It was my first time at Mamagoto so had no idea what to expect. I'm enjoyed the atmosphere and the entertaining decor.

40,25-Sep-16,Good Place Good Food - Buffet,"Opted for the Buffet. Overall verdict: Reasonably good at this price point.The Soup - Hot & Sour was very average.The starters - The prawns, the fish and the chicken were quite good. We asked for the Fried Spinach Wonton - was above average - the filling a cheese-spinach mix.The chicken Momos I thought were well made we that unique flavour that took me back to Sikkim.We ordered for mixed veg and tofu stir fry at the wok counter. Just a garlic and a dash of light soy sauce and it was brilliant.In the main section - the lamb stood out. In fact I wished for some more but my brain asked me to stop!!I give a 3.75!!!The mint Mocktail was prepared well.The dessert section - the sponge cake with toffee sauce and coco ice-cream was exquisite. The baked strawberry yoghurt was not bad.The crew though polite were either overworked or not trained. They were constantly forgetting to serve us.As I said overall - must visit. The minute negatives I am hoping were all aberrations!!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or90-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
40,24-Sep-16,Conventionally unusual,"This place offers Asian food that's truly fun and truly fusion. They have what you think is standard fare but with some interesting variations - e.g., a ""Chinese Pepper Soup"" with 22 ingredients - it's essentially a Hot & Sour soup but yet, not a Hot & Sour Soup.Even the decor is fun & fusion, the portion sizes are quite generous and the food as well as service are good. When I visited all of us were vegetarian and their fare was excellent.It's quite expensive though (each entree is about 500+, mocktails about 350+) and the though the ambience is nice and appropriate for kids, families & couples, the prices are more commensurate with fine dining restaurants. Best to go as a group of 4-6 to get best value for your money.I would definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or90-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

It is located on the popular Hill Road in Bandra at the place where the once famous Gazebo Oriental Restaurant used to be for several decades & has closed down now. Being a busy road, Parking is a challenge, but thankfully they offer Valet Parking, so that's a good thing. The Restaurant is fairly large inside & has a cool, enticing decor, which makes it a lovely place to spend a nice evening with friends or family. They have an extensive food & full bar menu, their Waiters are well trained, knowledgeable and helpful, the Service is quick & their Rates are reasonable - all of which add up to make this a Popular Watering Hole & Eating Place as well in a highly competitive area like Bandra where there is no dearth of restaurants serving good food. The food is freshly prepared & tasty and they also have several unique items, which the Waiters will assist you in understanding & correctly ordering. Their Washrooms are clean & the Wash Basin Faucets are a Unique Kettle with water coming out from their Spouts – Very Nice indeed.Certainly a good place to visit if you have not been here before & worth visiting again too !!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or90-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

It's definitely not worth the price!Even the Pad Thai we ordered was soggy unlike the authenthic Pad thai I tried at some Thai restaurants.The service is quick and good.

40,8-Jul-16,Great Fusion,"Ok so this weekend I finally made my way to one of Mumbai outlets of Mamagotos who I consider primarily a Delhi chain .First things first , they have quite an efficient valet service and friendly staff taking reservations for stray walkins like us. It was after a good thirty minute wait that we got a table for two at this quite cramped eatery. Light subdued music in the background , nice wall art and reasonably conferrable seating.I don't know if they have a different menu for Mumbai or it has been so long that I visited one of their NCR outlets , that they changed it. It was quite limited , compared to the one I remember ordering out of .Anyways , after settling down , we ordered for our starters , a portion of old school Chicken Gyoza (₹319/-) , a steamed Red Snapper, Java Grilled Fish in red Hot Sambal Salsa With RTV (₹629/-+ ) ( they had a choice of this this and other fish dishes , in sea bass , sole & red snapper at various price points , a nice touch , me thinks ) along with a portion of Chinese sour and pepper soup with 22 ingredients (₹259+)Though we were asked that they are out of Gyoza so did we mind switching our order to Chicken with chilli oil dumplings , which we agreed to and were also billed for , but we were actually served with Gyoza , in my mind the original Japanese version of the popular American pot stickers , steamed and then pan seared , chicken dumplings in a tangy soya based sauce bath , an all time favourite of mine but not really appreciated by Anita Shetty, my better half as also the dinner companion. The snapper was firm , fresh and well cooked , but not grilled ? Rather steamed , wrapped in a banana leaf with a red chilly based paste on the side , again a just ok kind of dish as the only flavour to it was that of the chilly paste smeared on it , no real snapper flavour. The soup , divided into two servings , on the other hand was actually quite delicious , one word of advice , the serving dishes look huge but in fact they are thick bottomed , so the serve sizes are not as huge as they look. After this mixed start we ordered our mains , a portion of vegetable sticky fried rice (₹269/-) and a sliced chicken in black bean sauce with mushrooms (₹429/-+) . Now sticky rice is not a favourite of mine but Anita loves it and was totally impressed by what was served here and the chicken in a mushroom based sauce was a hit with both of us. We were actually planning to order another main but our server rightly advices not to , as the serve size was truly enough , we had to doggy bag some of it and any additional order would have been a waste , that is what I call honest service , really appreciated. With the mains ,we ended our more than satisfactory meal forgoing the deserts.So all in all a nice informal kind of place recommended for a decent taste and value Asian meal. One important note though , this place is not your regular Chinese restaurants , rather as they say in their tag line , they are a Fun Asian Eating , so plan accordingly.ENJOY",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or100-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

10,3-Jul-16,Shocking and despicable experience.,"SHAME MAMAGOTOWhy I will not visit Mamagoto (Bandra) again.Yesterday my three old niece's privacy was compromised at this outlet. About 25 mins into the meal my sister looked up and noticed the waiter serving the table had his mobile phone pointed at my niece over Amma's (my mother-in-law) head.She immediately got up and told him to stop! He apologised and said he deleted the photo, however when She took his phone She discovered 2 videos of my niece still on it. Furious She asked him to call his manager while trying to delete the videos. (Unfortunately she only deleted the videos from the inbox and not from the delete folder, which she realised much later) The manager never arrived until She looked up and noticed that he was standing two feet away making no effort to come over and address the matter.Upon calling him, he dismissed the waiter and apologised. We asked for the bill as by now we had lost our appetite and my niece was in tears from all the commotion.While Amma left with the wailing child my sister waited to pay for the bill... The manager appeared a few minutes later and informed that they had taken care of the bill. Really? we're we going to except a free meal at the cost of our daughter's privacy?My sister paid and left. The restaurant was not crowded there were maybe three or four more tables. Most of these tables had children dining with their parents. Clearly this is a restaurant that prides itself on being family friendly...Unfortunately customer privacy is a point not covered in customer etiquette.In the evening We got a call from the manager of new restaurant openings of Mamagoto. She wanted to understand what happened and what can they do to rectify the matter. According to her they spoke to the waiter and explained to him that he should not have taken the photos without permission. Really?My sister asked her why is a waiter during service walking around with a mobile phone. Where is the question of asking the customer?She said she really wanted to help and what can she do.A line was crossed. Comping bills and apologies don't really cover up for that fact. And I'm not sure this young girl who called me realised the severity of what happened.So Mamagoto if you want to redeem yourself from the shame, here is what you can do so others who still choose to come to your outlet don't experience this negligent behaviour were their privacy is compromised.1. The waiter in question crossed a very serious line. The very fact that the manager who called told us he was spoken to and not suspended or removed from service indicates Mamagoto's lack of understanding how serious the act he committed was. Also it shows Mamagoto's willingness to condone such acts which is a Shame!2. Waiters/serving staff should NOT be allowed with mobile phones during service. There is no question of asking the customer permission to take pictures...that is a line crossed! Please realise this.3. Managers should be monitoring tables and waiters to see service runs smoothly not parading around with fancy walkie talkies in suits! If your manager was doing his job he would have immediately noticed:a. That the waiter making faces at children is inappropriate... my niece mentioned twice that that man (waiter) is making faces at her. It's plain inappropriate NOT cute or funny! Plus why would one put a parent/ child in a situation where some adult stranger is making them feel uncomfortable?b. The food served arrived with out serving spoons!!! We had to literally put our hands up like school kids to get our/any waiters attention so we could eat.4. Pls hire qualified training professionals to train and sensitise your staff on customer etiquette. The system you currently have does NOT protect client privacy at any level.Put these procedures in place so that other families don't feel vulnerable and their privacy not compromised at any of your outlets.Until then all I can say is - SHAME MAMAGOTO.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or110-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

The 45-minute wait for a table was worth it, considering it was a Friday evening and we reserved late. There's a waiting area outside where you can watch sports channels and the mindless mayhem. At least 20 people chatting away. Friendly decor inside, their signature graffiti, bare brick walls, busy bartender, high walls.All three of us ordered their cucumber mint mocktail. Consistency can be a family problem at times. I was dying for a soup and had their Oriental Clear Chicken soup. Great taste, hearty serving even after splitting a bowl between two. My sis had the tom yum shrimp which was zesty and sharp.The Spicy Bangkok Chicken Bowl and Smoky BBQ Pork Belly Bowl were excellent. The server thoughtfully put an extra stick of pork for us, seeing that we were sharing. The pork was barbecued to a crisp outer, while tender inside. Warm and yummy, while the chicken bowl had kick.

Now all this was done quietly n politely with my husband saying no problem mistake could happen with anyone.anyway 6 months later when we visited again and soon as we were seated the manager came over and assured us that the unpleasant experience you had hope it's a thing of the past.

30,27-Jan-16,Good Asian Street Food,"This review is for the Andheri West MamagotoIt's tucked away in a quiet by lane opposite Citi Mall. We were greeted with a smile and promptly led to a table.I found the ambiance very confusing though. All the mismatched chairs and the jail like grills of the upper seating area, the cycle tyres in the dividers. It felt as if somebody was trying too hard to be hip.The Menu had a neat clean look to it. Especially appreciated the fact that dishes were clearly marked as ""small portions."""" In my opinion they were decent sized starter portions though marked small.We had satay chicken and crispy fried lotus stem as starters. The satay was a bit on the chewy side and the peanut sauce was just not up to standard.The crispy lotus stem and the honey dipping sauce more than made up for the satay though. It was lipsmaking delicious.Seasoned perfectly with red chilli flakes and garlic.For the main course we ordered the Osaka station street food bowl. One large serving was more than enough for the three of us. It was bland as per Indian tastes but I LOVED the flavor. Extremely filling too.Moot question will I go back in spite of the few negatives on the first visit. Yes. I would love to try out a few more of their dishes. All in all it was value for money",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or140-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

40,19-Oct-15,NICE ASIAN FUSION CUISINE !,"The Mamagato Asian Restaurant chain (""Fun Asian Eating"") has made a name for itself in Mumbai over the past few years, but we were not sure if their Bandra outlet would handle a large group of over 20 for dinner on a weekend. Thankfully they agreed, the only condition being an early 7:30 pm start. It is on the old Gazebo Restaurant premises on a very crowded part of Hill Road, but luckily offer valet parking, which is a great help.The Restaurant itself is not very decorative, either outside or inside, fairly bare except for a string of small porcelain figures hanging from a wooden trellis at the entrance, and some stylistic paintings/prints on the walls. It is divided into four sections, three in the main hall with a bar, and a narrow section at the rear left.Our guests were coming in from all over Mumbai, and some of them did not arrive on time, which made the seating & service quite difficult ! The manager gave us an extra-long single table dining arrangement, which practically ran across the entire restaurant ! While waiting for everyone to come in, we ordered drinks & wine from their wine list. It was nice to see that they featured several Indian wines in their List, & we ordered Grovers Art Collection Sauvignon Blanc & Grovers La Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon by the bottle. The absatiners had Fresh Lime & Soda / Water.We had not pre-ordered, and it would have been a nightmare for the large group to order a la carte, so we nominate a couple ogf our lady-guests to order for all in bulk, keeping the nos. of vegetarians also in mind. Starters were Hot basil Chicken Cups, Veg basil Cups, Crispy Chilly Potato, Corn Fritter Balls, Shrimp with dry red chilli & burnt garlic. Mains were Thai Green Curry - Chicken & Veg., Chicken in Black Bean Sauce + Mushroom, Stir Fried Veg., Smoky Barbecued Pork Belly, accompanied by Udon Noodles, Fried & steamed rice.Of course, there were multiple orders for each of the above, and we added some more during the meal as we ate.They had allotted two waiters exclusively to our large table, so they were kept really busy throughout ! They were courteous & smiling in spite of the multi[ple demands & trips to & from the kitchen !What was very impressive was that all the dishes were made well & tasted great, the mixed & bulk ordering did not detract from the quality of the food served. And there were other guests too, apart from our group, to be served. All our guests were unanimously happy at the end of the mealThe bill came to around Rs. Rs.2000 per head, somewhat pricey for Asian cuisine, and included taxes and a 10% service charge. But it was worth it. They also do takeaways & home delivery in Bandra.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or150-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
30,8-Oct-15,Asian Option in Bandra,"Even though not great in ambience & looks when you enter this place, but the people are nice. Being a veggie, they offered us limited choice. Mocktails were good, especially the canberry one. Veg basil cups were good but the kids enjoyed crispy chilli potato. The som tam salad was spicy but good enough for repeat order. The veg options in noodles and burn garlic were decent.

The server was extremely kind with our request and assisted us with our queries. We had order for a Chicken Phad Thai. It was a bit disappointing as we found more pieces of tofu than chicken.

We couldn't stop ourselves from ordering desert and again were quite happy with the pudding that was served.

He took feedback positively for improvements in the food as well as the compliments over items well prepared. Their sponge cake with toffee sauce and icecream was amazing (even though we avoided the sauce). One stiff mojito on an empty stomach was enough to get the 'feel good' factor. :)The papaya salad ordered wasn't great and was replaced with other more palatable options like the hua hin rolls and dim sums. The khao suey was delicious as were some of the other items were ordered.This place is definitely on our list of places to eat at more often for Asian cuisine.They could improve on maintenance as the air condition was dripping water from the ceiling, some of which were directly on our table / us.

40,30-Aug-15,A definite Go To!,"Visited Mamagoto at Hill road this weekend. Being a Sunday it was quite busy. The interiors are definitely quirky and not like your run of the mill restaurant with a lot of kitschy artwork decorating the walls. Started off with Crispy Chilly potatoes, Crab cakes and Indonesian grilled chicken all of which were excellent. This was followed by the fiery shrimp fried rice,soho pan fried noodles and phad thai noodles and rounded off by caramel sponge cake and crunchy nutella mousse. All of the dishes were fantastic and the experience was only enhanced by attentive staff. I do have a grouse though..the condensation on the ventilation pipes/vents causes water to drip on unsuspecting people sitting below them. Although they had a person wiping off the excess moisture it was to no avail so customers are advised to avoid sitting under the vents . Something the management might want to look into. Otherwise a good experience overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or160-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

40,4-Aug-15,Excellent service!!,"Very few times you get to eat an exquisite Coconut Ice Cream(complimentary) and topping it off with great, immaculate service. Mamagoto did that. :) Coming on a weekend, and a decent wait period of half an hour, we treated ourselves to some amazing Asian food. Not sure if the place is synonymous with its meaning though, because it was our first time.The dumplings were pretty okay, and for the price, not value for money at all(just 4 pieces). The crust a tad too thin making it break away easily every time we picked one. Soft nonetheless, but could have been better. Same for the Gyoza. The fried Lotus Stems were great and the sauces delectable. Their signature dish are the Rice Bowls. The Penang Curry had a little overdose of water chestnut which was evident as the after taste. I'd prefer it to be subtle. Should've tried the Chiang Mai station noodles or the Teriyaki with Tofu. Other wise, it was spot on, the sticky rice and the veggies lent a fine balance. What we appreciated more than the food was the fab service by Pawan. It is very rare that the one taking your order and serving you actually listens to you! And Pawan was bang on. He ensured we did not over order and his service was quick. I wish there are more folks like him! I'll come back to Mamagoto just for this man.Add to this a pretty cool ambience, with lively music in the background and a decently stocked bar, it is a pretty cool place to have Asian cuisine. Damage comes to approx 1000 per person. Nice mid-range pricing. Will I come back for more? Anything for that smashing Coconut Ice Cream(which was even better than Naturals if I have to pick a winner).",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or170-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

50,17-Jul-15,Awesome little place,Luv the anime ambiance. Anything you order here is so tasty. The service is fantastic ! I had a dietary restriction and the chef came to my table to understand my order! We had the Indonesian chicken skewers. I had a stir fry chicken and vegetables. We had rum n Pepsi.

40,12-Jul-15,Dinner,Good experience overall wrt food and service. Ambience needs a little bit of face lift. Some tables have varied chairs which gives a very uneven look. Tried a new slim diet salad with south african lentils ( still not in the menu ) and it was awesome. Debraj took special care.

40,7-Jul-15,Review of Mamagoto,"The bustling Hill Road in Bandra spoils you for choice, doesn’t it? There during lunch hours yesterday, we choose Mamagoto.Located where Nature’s Basket used to be, Mamagoto is not difficult to find. And it has a big bright yellow door to catch your attention.Done up with mix and match furniture, oriental paintings, nice lighting and quirky décor items, the place is definitely interesting to the first-timer! And it is big too…..can accommodate quite a few diners!For starters, we wanted something with Calamari since our daughter had been craving for Calamari for some time now. But no, it wasn’t available. We settled for the next best item then – prawns. Prawn Tempura – served with two different sauces, and served in a huge portions, we thoroughly enjoyed the prawns.For Main Course, we choose something called ‘A Thai Lost in Hunan’ – Spicy thai lamb in red curry and served on pad thai noodles – we were in a good mind to order another dish when the guy who was waiting on us advised us that the lamb would be enough. Sure, we asked him. For we were 3 of us. He nodded in confidence. Allright, we said. And were pleasantly surprised to see he was right. Damn right. We struggled to finish even the lamb bowl. The guy smiled his knowing smile when we thanked him.Rs 1200 for the above 2 items without drinks and desserts. Maybe the huge portions justify the rate. For, in any other place, we’d have to order 2 main course dishes and would have probably the same amount of money.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or180-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
40,3-Jul-15,Superb Food,"Really nice food and good ambiance. Had the Khaosuey and the Thai Curry, both really good! All the starters can be skipped.

40,3-Jul-15,A relaxing place,"Visiting Mumbai after many years and were taken for dinner here. One of a chain, it's a Pan-Asian restaurant with decor that matches the theme. We had only the vegetarian dishes which were flavourful. The portions were generous and the food came quickly, partially on request, because we had a flight to catch. The check took much longer to arrive!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or180-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
40,25-Jun-15,Yummy food,"Mamagoto serves some of the best Pan-Asian food on the menu with a spicy kick to it. They make some fine cocktails too, especially the watermelon jalapeno margerita. I especially liked the Fiery Thai Shrimp Fried Rice with Asian green chilli chicken ribbons. For dessert though, the must-have is their banoffee pie which is surely the stuff heaven is made of.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or180-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
40,23-Jun-15,Pan Asian with a spicy Indian twist,"Great, Loose atmosphere in a hip area of Mumbai (Bandra West). Cosy and Noisy.

30,10-Jun-15,Good ambience and decent food,"Mamagoto is an Asian eatery with decent starters and main course. I had noodles in green curry, and starters of corn and mix vegetables. The food is good, though not superlative. Portion size was really big - enough for two people. Desserts looked good, though I did not have them because the main course and starters were huge.

40,3-Jun-15,A small gem at Kalaghoda,"A small restaurant with efficient quick service and a vast menu. We have visited twice, always on a weekday at around 7.45/8pm and the place is buzzing by the time its 9.30 with not an empty table in sight. The food is fresh and tasty and the service is knowledgeable.. the mezzanine can get a bit hot when crowded. The seafood soup is very good and most of the portions are to share. I hope the place keeps up its standard as it gets competition from a lot of other small joints around the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or180-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

30,18-May-15,"Nice, lively atmosphere","Nice, lively atmosphere and the place is generally crowded. Took me ages to get to eat here as they never accepted reservations when they opened. Dinner review on 17th Dec 2014 - In the starters, the hot basil chicken in lettuce cups are really good. Avoid the Chinese sour & pepper soup. Among themains, the java grilled fish was bland and smells fishy but tasted better withsalsa on top. The prawns with ground pepper, basil & garlic in the wok/curries section are a great choice. The stir fried chicken udon noodles are well worth a shot. Service was attentive till it came to getting the bill. A meal for 5 with 5 alcoholic drinks & no desserts = Rs:5,078 incl. 10% service charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or190-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

30,13-May-15,Not bad! Not great either.,"This place seems to be constantly busy but if you have eat Thai, Malay, Indonesian foods in their respective countries; you know that that's not what it tastes like. It's alright if you have no other place to go and you really want to eat a mixture of random Asian cuisines. They do a few good noodle and salad dishes. They serve alcohol so it's easier to digest their food.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or190-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

30,29-Apr-15,Good Dining only place,"Mamagoto - Asian place, true to it's name.We visit last week and there was an IPL Offer on Beers. Our humble, obvious question - You have an IPL offer but no screens to show IPL?? Wow.. This was crazy marketing.The ambience of the place is nice, very colorful and friendly. The air conditioning in some areas was too chilly so we had to move to a different table but they accommodated our request immediately since it wasn't very crowded.My first ever experience with salads was with my friend, Shivani, here at mamagoto. She ordered Som Tam Salad - which I told her was wrong in all senses - first it was a ""salad"" and that too a ""veg"" one. She however insisted so I said u order that while I start with chicken. I don't recall the chicken dish we ordered as it was nice but not something that left an impression. I do remember that the quantity was great. Salad, however, was WOWWW!! Papaya salad served with a tangy Thai dressing n some peanuts on it. Amazing taste - I hogged on it.Soups are nice too but the must try is the noodle bowl. We had stir fry udon noodles and enjoyed it very much. One bowl was enough for 2 people.Overall a great dining only experience.

40,9-Apr-15,Very Good Food,Checked in with family for a birthday. The place is nicely done and food was pretty good overall. We ordered CRISPY CHILLY POTATO which were really tasty. THAI CRISPY VEGETABLES were little bland and not really interesting. THAI VEG BASIL CUPS were much better and tasted quite good. SOM TAM SALAD was little spicy and nice. ORIENTAL CLEAR VEG SOUP was very ok ok.For main course we had VEG STIR FRY UDON NOODLES & STREET VENDOR's PENANG CURRY BOWL which comes with sticky rice. Kids ordered and enjoyed the VEG HAKKA NOODLES.We ordered few mocktails also -VIRGIN MOJITO - same as always and nice.LEMON ZEST + MINT LEMONADE - best for citrus lovers.KIWI MINT COLLINS - really nice.PASSION FRUIT + ORANGE COOLER - again a decent drink.Overall a good dining experience though I felt we didn't order that much of variety but still we enjoyed.

40,4-Apr-15,Awesome food n friendly staff,This place never fails to disappoint....went with my daughter who drools over the chicken noodles and took another friend of hers. The eight year old girls loved their chicken soup n noodles and i enjoyed the grilled tofu with miso sauce n a huge helping of veg laksa....one of their signature dishes. The pineapple beach comber mocktail though was a bit flat.

For a vegeterian like me also , they had variety of options in starters as well as Main course.Altough 2-3 items were not so hot when served which needs to be improved like the soup , the garlic noodles etc. However given the choice of food , this is a good place for buffet lunch.Surprise came in the last which were the desserts of which two were eggless which i could eat and wallah, they were so hand licking good. I a definitely visiting this place again and this time it will be the dessert first , but the desserts are not unlimited :(Ensure you have some apetite and some portion of your stomache empty after lunch for the lovely desserts.Worth the penny charged.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or200-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

It was his choice of restaurant and I was very pleasantly surprised upon entry with the calm dim lighting and the chilled atmosphere.Given a warm welcome by the lovely staff, I automatically got extremely comfortable with my dinner company and we proceeded to order. As it was my first time, my company advised me on a dish to order. It was a very interesting dish - a pot dish which was a mixture of soup, noodles, chicken and vegetables all spiced up in a beautiful mix - truly enjoyable and satisfying! I found the food to be very tasty and I do wish I had the opportunity to explore more of the menu! Ah well... definitely next time!After my dinner, it was great as the staff were happy for myself and my company to pose for photos whilst they took them - there was no reluctance from the staff. They then proceeded to help me get a safe cab back to my hotel - which was much appreciated!I wish I had the chance to go back!

On the fourth time when they said it would only take 10minutes we finally succumbed.We loved the ambience but found the place to be incredibly noisy.The food gets 4 out of 5 stars. The prawn tempura we ordered as a starter was nice and crispy and the portions were pretty big. For the main course we had ordered a steam fish with lemon and a street vendors penang curry bowl and we would easily recommend both. But be warned the curry bowl is a large portion so those with medium appetites will struggle to finish even half after the starters.All in all, a must visit for anyone looking for good asian food.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or210-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

To start with the interiors is quite good and cozy, not jazzy per say. Seating is good and the ambient temperature perfect for good meal. We ordered a couple of drinks and also ordered for Barbecue Chicken starter on the recommendation of the Steward. It was mouthwatering and succulent chicken with amazing sauces, and was on the spicier side, exactly how my pallets like it. Then we ordered for the classic chicken wings and this too was awesome, crispy and spicier. We had spent almost 2 hours with these starters and a couple of drinks and the time just flew.

30,19-Nov-14,"Good ambience, okay food & bad drinks",Ambience : the ambience remains the beat part about this restaurant. I wonder if it can be called Chinese kitsch but its nice with dull lighting.Food: been here twice and would not say I would go there anytime soon as there are a lot of other great Chinese places to choose from. The chilly garlic potato was dry and like French fries. The kung pao chicken was which I have eaten at all the Chinese restaurants in Bombay and happens to be my goto food was disappointing . the flavour of chicken and the crunch of cashews with a sweet/ spicy taste is what you look for. The dish didn't meet my expectation. The Thai veg curry also felt like it was made from those ready to make Thai pastes. The only good thing is the serving size so what you order for two can work for three.Drinks: ordered a kiwi margarita. Was watery and again made using squash. Not too my liking when j have had them with fresh kiwi and that one tastes awesome .Overall okay place but not in my GOTO list anymore.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or220-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
30,16-Nov-14,Disappointed,For our usual Chinese craving we go to mainland china but for a change we have been thinking of going to mamagoto for a while. Finally we did. There was 1+1 on drinks so it was lucrative. We ordered beer and sangria. Sangria was so sweet that I could not finish my second drink. We love momos and ordered some. The most dry momos I have ever had with no flavour. We also ordered fried shrimp which was good. But then how wrong can you go with frying stuff. We were so disappointed we decided to have main course at our usual comfort zone : mainland china.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or220-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

50,6-Oct-14,A Gem of a Find in Kala Ghoda/Fort,"NOTE: This is a review of the Kala Ghoda branch of Mamagoto.We came into this place with just the intention of enjoying its happy hour (as even small chain restaurants are usually not our preference), but we stayed and had a wonderful meal as well. The two-level restaurant is open in feel and pleasant, a nicely cooling respite from the heat. We started with an unusual appetizer, vegetable basil cups, really a corn-basil veg mixture, that truly awoke our tastebuds especially with the tangy sauce accompanying it. We were hooked. We added a stir-fried vegetable with tofu and a terrific noodle dish, the chiang mai train station noodles, light noodles in a sprightly,attention-getting coconut curry sauce. The service was as attentive as you expect in Mumbai, but they were also happy to customize/adapt the meals in spiciness and timing just for us. We would go back again and again for all the other interesting items on the menu - including the nicely priced lunch specials.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or220-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
40,6-Oct-14,Nice food and efficient service,"I was visiting Mumbai after a long time and while I had plans of visiting one of the old favorites in Bandra, I came across Mamagoto since the other restaurant was full.It looks a nondescript place from the outside, with all that you see is a lot of tigers pasted on the glass. The valet was prompt enough to park the car and we entered to an almost full restaurant on a Friday afternoon.The Menu was confusing, since it wasnt closer to what the map - which took us to this place described this being a chinese restaurant. It had a lot of Thai dishes too.We ordered - Chicken Satay with peanut sauce as appetizers, along with our drinks - which came in some innovative glasses. Green Apple Mojito came in a glass which resembled a glass bottle, and the other drink was vodka based with a hint of vanilla and orange.The decor and ambiance is good. The walls have been left untouched, a concept I have seen at more and more places lately. The seating was comfortable too.For Main course we ordered the Wok - with chicken and Mushroom and Fried Rice to go along with that. It was a great combination and we enjoyed a lot.The service is efficient, quick and the staff has good knowledge about the food on offer. They will help you only when asked for and will not keep on suggesting something.Would look forward to a visit here when I am in Mumbai next time",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or220-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

40,23-Sep-14,Good food- Slip Showing in Service,"Success and service do not go together sometimes. If you have a full house with 72 covers, it is not surprising to expect a breakdown in service sometimes. Went for a lunch on a working day-that too a Tuesday. But the place got full before we got our food. Well, this wasn't a few minutes but plenty of minutes (felt like an hour!) during which we were fretting since I had a flight to catch! Any number of reminders, follow-ups fell on deaf ears. The big positive was, everyone was very polite and apologetic-something about two big groups being very demanding. Anyway, the food was terrific as usual and the staff was very polite- in the end for terrible service-promising it wont happen again. I hope they are right! Mistakes do happen. But they did serve us the dessert without charging us-that was nice gesture and a way of apologizing which we accepted. Seems to be a nice bunch of people including the manager. But they do need to improve the standards-someone else might have created a bad scene! But, I have been to the restaurant in Delhi Khan Market and love their food with generous portions and will go again and yet again-but when I have time on hand. Wines are absolutely ridiculously high and inconsistently priced though. Management does not seem to have any clue about the wine business-it appears. STAY AWAY FROM ORDERING ANY WINE IN THE RESTAURANT- I'd give a 1/5 for the wine value for money!! Stick to beer or jasmine tea. (Sorry gave 4/5 for value for this reason only-food alone 5/5)",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or230-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

50,19-Aug-14,"Good Food, the Right Ambience with Great Service!","It was a rainy afternoon when my wife and I found ourselves at Hill Road Bandra, looking for a quiet place to have a quick lunch. We came across this signboard with the name Mamagoto and entered the restaurant not knowing what to expect.From the time we entered, we were treated as revered guests. We were offered various seats and we chose to sit by the full-length glass windows overlooking the road outside.We ordered 'Hot Basil Chicken Cups' for starters, which consisted of roughly minced spicy chicken on round iceberg lettuce leaves. For the main course we had 'Sticky Fried Rice with Egg' with a very nice coconut-milk based 'Lamb Masaman Curry'. All the items ordered were very tasty and quantity for two was absolutely sufficient.The best part was the service - prompt, unobtrusively attentive, and courteous.Overall, it was a great experience and would recommend this eatery to anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or230-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
40,3-Aug-14,Weeknight dinner,"We visited this place over a weekday. The ambiance is very relaxed and vibrant at the same time. I had always heard of this place being a winner with their cocktails, and with what I had tried that night, I think they lived up to it.So to start with, we ordered a set of Non-vegetarian dim-sums and Watermelon martinis to go with it. The drink was very fresh and really well made. Full marks for that. Next the dim-sums, they were good too.We really wanted to try their set menu as it looked like they had some interesting things to offer. Starting with their vegetarian dimsum and spring rolls. This spring roll needs a round of applause! So fresh and so balanced a spring roll, with a hint of Kaffir lime leaf in it (the Manager told us so) I am very sure that it is one of the finest vegan spring rolls that I have had, and has made me turn around and look at vegan spring rolls in a new light and fondness :) Compared to that the corn dim-sums were pretty average.Their sweet corn soup was mild, well balanced and good. Pretty ordinary but palatable.Our final course was the bowl of noodles/ rice in a desired sauce with choice of Chicken/ fish or prawns. I had opted for Noodle in Chili Hoisin sauce with Chicken, while my friend went with Noodles in Black bean sauce with Fish. There was an unlimited serving for this bowl, so if you are hungry soul this could be a set menu for you! I quite liked my bowl of goodness, the fish was also quite good.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or230-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

The menu too is unique, matches to ambience. Also offers paintings and souvenirs (there is a price to it) The Staff - warm, courteous & friendly, prompt service.Value for Money #vfm when it comes to service & ambience but it fails when it comes to Taste - ""a little more than average"" & quantity served is moderate.Will not comment on what I tried as each of us has varied choice when it comes to taste.The bad things - 'spicy' was not spicy, it was very very spicy - quality needs attention. Vegetarians have very limited choices & staff needs to be more trained on explaining the cuisine.My pick: chicken with bamboo shoot schezwan sauce and caramel sponge cake with toffee sauce.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or230-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

20,14-May-14,Fleecing on Pretext of Charging Service Tax,"Last Wednesday, we visited this place and our food and drinks bill was about Rs. 4000/- plus. We were charged 10% Service charges amounting to about Rs. 400/-. However, we were charged Service Tax @ a little less than 5% on food and liquor bill of Rs. 4000/-. When the matter was pointed out to the manager that he should have charged Service Tax only on the Rs. 400/- Service Charges, he had the audacity to tell us that instead of charging ST @ 12.36% he had charged us only 5%. This is wrong. The ST rate for Restaurant is about 4.95%. No matter what we told him, he refused to accept and relent. He even stated that their chartered accountants have okayed this, which means even their tax consultants are involved int his racket. Thus all the guests of this place are being fleeced. The ST has to be charged only on the service provided for which the Restaurant is charging 10% over the food bill. I think we need to be aware of this as normally other places would readily accept such an error, but not this place making it appear to be a deliberate act.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or240-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

Further there was no space to even keep two dinner plates. Even though I did mention this to the staff there was no response from them.Coming to the food, I found the food to be average at best. They did take a while to serve the food & there was no recommendation from the staff.

Malasian Rice and chicken starters are also good. Ambience is okay ( the management has done up the place without spending much on it). Service is very good. Waiters are pretty friendly.

The service is not too bad.They don't take reservations for weekends which is better in a way..It isn't very difficult to get a table..even if you have to wait for a table, it doesn't take too long to get one... they are very organised.They have valet parking.Only problem we had was, from their limited desert menu, they didn't have two deserts that we asked for..so check what they have before you decide.I highly recommend this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or250-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

The ambience @ thier R city outlet is clean, bright, and strangely hunger inducing!No complains on that front. Service is prompt, with the chef coming out to greet us and check on the feedback occassionally.A welcome change from the regular 'Chinese' restaurants where the most ordered dishes seem to be Hakka noodles & manchurian!

40,5-Jan-14,Beautiful place -- hard to get a table,"We went there as a group of 4 one day and the wait was 1.5 hours, so we left! For the next 2 days, we kept calling them to find out how much the wait was. Finally, on our 4th call, the lady said that there's no wait at that particular moment. It was a Thursday evening around 7.30 pm or so. We went there as a group of 6 and got seated within 5 minutes.The decor was beautiful -- casual rustic. We got a secluded table for 6 which was perfect for our group. The servers were overwhelmed with the crowd and couldn't give a lot of time to the guests, so it felt a bit rushed. We ordered drinks and food, and the stuff arrived a bit out of order, but that's fine.The food was delicious! I don't think there's a better panang curry in Mumbai. I wasn't impressed by their vegetarian food -- the stir fried lotus stem was not that great, but everything else was on the mark.Overall, this place is a 4 out of 5 (good but not great). I would go back again whenever I visit Mumbai, but only if the wait is not crazy that night.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or260-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

30,21-Dec-13,No value for money,"I visited the Mamagoto restaurant at R City Ghatkopar as I wanted to experiment. My decision was bad as they their fusion really lacks teeth. The dimsums/ momos are no good. Service and ambience is good, but when it comes to taste, it almost looks like u have ordered for an Indian curry using oriental vegetables. Too expensive for what they serve. Specially at R City, where u have several choices available, it seemed foolish that we ate here. Wouldn't recommend anyone. Whatever Chinese we get in India is anyway Indianiased but this seemed an exaggeration and failed to impress. A per person cost for one soup, starter and one maincourse easily crosses Rs1000/- per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or260-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
50,18-Dec-13,"Excellent fusion food. Not for fans of Fake, Indianised Chinese.","As someone who has lived in Singapore and Hong Kong, I have high expectations from Oriental cuisine restaurants in India and I'm usually disappointed. But Mamagoto served us lovely, innovative food in a lovely, lively atmosphere. This is the kind of place that most people used to the ""malasa-fied stuff"" at 5 Spice, Mainland China, etc... won't like. The Basa was light and tasty, the spinach salad was really different and tasty, the red curry prawn with sticky rice was hearty.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or260-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
50,13-Dec-13,Best pan Asian restaurant in Mumbai,"This place is second to none when it comes to Asian food in Mumbai. A perfect blend of great food, excellent service and funky ambiance is what makes this place truly amazing. The servers are very friendly and the service is quick. This is one place where the server’s recommendations are actually really good – the first time when I went there (with 3 other friends) , the server really insisted on us getting the Sponge cake with toffee sauce, in fact he was so insistent that we told him to get it complimentary for us, and to our surprise he did! Not only did we did we gobble down the cake but ended up ordering another one as well- it’s now my favorite dessert @ MamagotoRecommendations:Vegetarian:• Basil Cups• Tom yum soup• Plain sticky rice (tastes best with soy sauce)• Chang Mai Train station Noodles – Veg (MUST HAVE)• Sponge Cake with toffee sauce (MUST HAVE)Non Vegetarian:• Satay Chicken with peanut sauce• Bacon wrapped shrimp (A MUST HAVE for shrimp lovers)• Chicken in Black bean sauce• Chang Mai Train station Noodles – Chicken",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or260-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
40,25-Nov-13,Good authentic Asian food,"Excellent collection of pan Asian dishes without adulterating them. I liked the ambience and the quality of the food. Service was good compared to Indian standard and same as Indian standard as to the staffs knowledge of the food. Universal issue in India compared to other world cities. One comment - ""Khow suey"" is a Burmese dish while Chiang Mai is in Thailand and both the countries have very distinct food. Here they have made a Burmese dish originate from a Thai city railway station.Quality of food and drinks are good and for a change the ambiance and size of the restaurant in Bandra is optimal but the fetishness of waiting and having a crowd hanging around does not work for me and they don't take reservations.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or270-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
20,24-Nov-13,Much ado about nothing,"Wife had wanted to visit this place from the time it opened and her friends kept on harping about how great it was. So one fine evening I chose to take the missus out to dine here and surprisingly for a friday night managed to get a table (they don't take reservations for some reason, making it rather tough to get a table unless you are willing to wait) as soon as we reached! Its a tad bit smaller for a 70+ seating restaurant, making it a rather loud place to sit for a quite dinner with some privacy. The food was ordered and it took a good 30+ mins to be served; oh actually it wasn't quite served. The server just got the food and kept it on the table and we had to serve it ourselves...suppose that's their standard here, 'cause in their Delhi outpost at Citywalk they serve you the food. Anyway, for the amount of time we waited, the eventual bill we paid for a starter and two main course and beverages and the hoo-haa surrounding this place, it was just about average. I mean, there are better places serving exactly the same food at the same price, but a hundred times better, in the city. I'd rate their Delhi restaurant way higher than my experience here; consistency seems to be an issue here. Hope they take note of the same and look at improving.A piece of advise to the management: if you chose to be present on social media, it would be a good idea to have someone respond well in time (not after 24hrs); time's of the essence and try not promoting your new location when you should be focusing on why a customer didn't enjoy the meal he paid for",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or270-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
40,22-Nov-13,Great Asian food,"Went to the r-city mall outlet for lunch after hearing some positive reviews. Glad I went there because the food was outstanding.The restaurant manager came over before the meal and assured us that anything we did not like would be replaced (a nice proactive offer I would say). Good news is that there was no need to do that.The only negative is that the vegetarians in the group had a much more limited choice than me. But again, it must be said that whatever they did order tasted great.And strangely, there was no crabmeat item on the menu!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or270-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
50,19-Nov-13,Awesome,"This is a treasure trove, absolutely fun ambience, great seating, the drinks are fabulous and they are not stingy whilst making a cocktail. Fantastic starters (although im a veg) .. their papaya salad is the best (if you can handle the spice) .. although their green thai curry wasn't like a thai curry at all but they compensated with their desserts... maybe you can skip the main course and use the saved up calories for dessert ... older crowd who doesn't like loud music and dingy corner should avoid, also no reservations so be there early :)",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or270-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
40,15-Nov-13,Nice!!!,"Walked in to its outlet at R city mall. The place was rather empty but so were all the other restaurants. The manager( we later found out that he was not the manager but the head of their Training) was excellent. He made sure we had a nice dinner. If you like Khow Suey (Burmese dish), they make a pretty good one. The chicken satay and momos were great too.. they have some very nice mocktails too..Worth a try and then u can decide if u will go again. .. we will!!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or270-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
40,8-Nov-13,Oh Mama GO TO!!!,"I remember passing by this restaurant a few months ago as it was getting ready to open and found myself wanting to try it just because of the funky name! I don't live in Bombay anymore so when I found myself there this weekend that went by, I felt it was time. We were four of us and we decided to go there for lunch. I had been told that the ambiance was much nicer at night but we had other plans so we decided to just go.We arrived at 12:30pm on a Sunday afternoon so we beat the crowd. I noticed that they have valet parking and could imagine it was a smart move as parking is always an issue anywhere in Bombay. During the course of the meal the restaurant filled up rapidly and there was even a waiting and I can imagine that the valets had their jobs cut out for them.As we entered the restaurant, I was immediately attracted by the decor. They kept to the whole Pan Asian decor without it being in your face and definitely tasteful in comparison to the ghastly red Chinese lanterns, porcelain cats flailing their arms and laughing Buddhas that other Chinese restaurants have. They do have tigers but as stickers on the shop frontage and I could imagine that those would look pretty cool at night with the lights shining on them! They have used little hard plastic china men curtains ( like beaded curtains) as their section separators and the wall art is decidedly oriental but tasteful. Even the loo was cool.... The tap was a teapot!!They've used red but really cleverly and you really feel you've come to a very nicely done oriental restaurant.Cool thing: The chopsticks come in a sleeve and on the back of the sleeve are instructions of how to use chopsticks. The instructions are a little playful and they're quite cool for people who don't know how to and funny to read for people who do!The staff is extremely attentive and courteous and orders were taken rapidly. They don't have a bar menu other than mocktails because we were told they operate on a daily liquor licence so if liquor is essential to your dining experience, I would recommend you call ahead to check. We were lucky and they had a license for that day so we ordered:A couple of glasses of the Sula Cabernet Shiraz @ Rs. 345/- per glass : Served at perfect temperature and quantity.A Corona (pint) @ Rs. 550/-A Hawain Punch @ Rs. 190/- : Very good mocktail which was a good mix of pineapple and orange juice, some other fruit and soda. Very refreshing!A few diet colas.We were hungry as hell and so we decided to order more starters than main courses. For our starters, the server helped us order:1. Chinese sour and pepper chicken soup @ Rs. 215/- : We just had to order the obligatory soup and this was their version of the regular hot and sour version one gets at other restaurants. Absolutely stunning. There was a smokiness and meatiness to the flavour that must have come from mushrooms or something. We had asked for the soup to be split into two and the portions were very generous.We liked that we could recognise that it was a version of hot and sour soup and yet the flavours were boldly different.2. Tangtze Grilled Fish @ Rs. 460/- : This was ordered off a special menu that they seemed to have in addition to the regular menu. Firstly, when it arrived, everyone went ""wow!"" The presentation was so good! A nice long fillet of perfectly cooked Basa topped with loads of pickled red and green chillies and dressed with a light soy sesame chilli sauce. The sauce was a bit sweet at first bite which I attribute to palm sugar, but the pickled chillies backed up that sweetness with a real solid kick. Now, I'm not a fan of Basa but I understood why the chef may have chosen this fish. It's delicate or almost no flavour complimented the sauce perfectly. If he had used a fishier tasting fish or even prawns, it may not have tasted as heavenly as it did. It was devoured in a matter of seconds!3. Prawns wrapped in bacon @ Rs. 555/- : What's not to love? Prawns...good, bacon good! They tell you on the menu that you get six pieces per portion. We were thinking of getting two portions and were glad we didn't, not because they were not good but because the helping was pretty big already. Six large prawns each wrapped in a generous slice of perfectly cooked bacon. I did get a bit of the un-rendered bacon rind on my prawn but I just pushed it aside and enjoyed the beautiful smokiness of the bacon with the prawn and the sweet sauce that glazed it. It's true... Everything tastes better with bacon :)4. Hot basil chicken cups @ Rs. 285/- : These were good but essentially lettuce cups with basil and chilli flavoured chicken mince. The seasoning and flavours were fabulous but the downer was the lettuce. When you're serving something hot in a salad leaf, it's probably best if you use iceberg (which is what I think they used) but keep the plating to the very last minute because as soon as the hot meat touched the leaf, it wilted and was consequently extremely hard to pick up. We also missed the crunch that the salad leaf should have provided. It died a senseless death :(5. Crispy lotus stems with burnt garlic and dried red chillies @ Rs. 250/- : This was also ordered off the special menu and honestly I was very skeptical to order it as the unappetising accompanying picture on the menu gave me the impression of the lotus stems being cut too thick and therefore not crisp. I'm glad this was ordered though because firstly, it was very crisp and not already sauced as these usually are in other Pan Asian restaurants. And secondly, the pickled chilli sauce that was served on the side, perfectly balanced the crisp, salty and very flavourful lotus stem.We were stuffed by now but had already ordered a couple of mains so we bravely ploughed through what we ordered:1. Schezwan Pepper Chicken Rice @ Rs. 525/- : I don't know if it was an aftermath of the phenomenal starters we had had, but on first bite this turned out to be just ok. The portions are huge! But, the rice if eaten on its own was tasteless and lacked basic seasoning. It came accompanied by a chilli oil but for some reason that tasted more sesame based to us. However, when you added the chilli oil, it gave exactly what the dish was screaming for - flavour! Very appealing to the eye and once eaten as intended, very good.2. Fiery Thai shrimp fried rice with Asian green chilli chicken ribbons @ Rs. 425/- : We ordered this just because it sounded so different! Again, huge portion and very appeasing to the eye but lacked depth in flavour if eaten alone. It had some pickled cucumber sticks and tomatoes on one side and a fried egg on top ( we had asked for it to be cooked through and not to leave it like a sunny side up which would actually look way cooler in a picture)The rice looked red but it wasn't spicy and the chicken was quite bland but it came with a very nice lemon chilli sauce (very different than any flavour profile I've had in this cuisine) and after that was poured on, it tasted pretty darn good.We decided that without the accompanying sauces, these were just slight variations of a regular Chinese fried rice and I guess that is exactly the thought the chef put behind these dishes. Very clever indeed.We had loads of left overs of the main course and they vacuum pack it very nicely. All with a smile :)Another cool thing: After we had stuffed ourselves delirious and asked for the bill, the server put down a painted dimsum box down on our table. We all groaned because we thought one of us had ordered dimsum and they'd just brought it out! Actually it was the way they serve you up the bill! Very cool indeed!This place is not cheap but it's not ridiculously expensive either. You must remember though that all the prices are exclusive of VAT and other applicable taxes.I took away the 1/2 point only because of the un rendered bacon fat and limp lettuce but for the rest, the meal was superlative!Would I visit again? A big fat YES!! Excellent food in general, superb service and a very funky ambiance.

First the location, not such a great location for a restaurant..with heavy traffic and big buses honking less than 10 meters from the entrance, a very old school and final resting place for some close by across the road, but then its mumbai and its hill road ..real estate is premium. The interior is about ok, nothing spectacular, a hostess and host greet you on entrance, and help you with the table, we were lucky, as it filled up within minutes ,and there was soon a waiting.About the food, as i have been doing for a few weeks now in any new place i visit,we let the server recommend us , and we were served some of the better dishes i have had in mumbai during this short 4 day trip around diwali. The restaurant does not partner with amex or citi, so dont expect any discounts, and though not very expensive, its not cheap either.

20,20-Oct-13,A real let down for true asian fusion lovers,"Great decor. Good service. Good drinks. However a complete miss on the food. We ordered the pad thai and a prawns main course. Neither of which indicated in the description that they would have sweet undertones. Unfortunately both dishes had an overload of sweet sauces. A real dissappointment given that we had high expectations given the rave reviews. The prawns however were very fresh and well cooked which was a relief. We ordered mud pie for dessert and while it was good, it wasnt a traditional mud pie. For a restaurant that claims to have a new take on asian influenced cuisine, Mamagoto has a long way to go.

I especially liked the graphics and key to 'healthy', 'spicy', etc dishes marked up on the menu that matches the interior decor. While the food is tasty, it's fusion, Asian-with a twist slant makes some of the dishes inconsistent. One rice was too spicy, the other too bland.

We started with the papaya salad (thai) - would say it was average; have had better at various pan asian restaurants. They have their version of veg Khowsuey (cant remember the name - something like noodles train ...) - that was really good & so was the chicken thai curry with steam rice. The Phad thai again was average. think they had yet not got the liquor permit or had ran out of beer so that was a bummer.

The calamaris with a spicy twist, grilled java fish and basil rice with chicken are worth a try. The restaurant also has around 20 odd in-house sauces which is also a good try. A pot of Jasmine tea served as a perfect ending to a good meal. I would definitely visit this place again.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or290-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai
30,30-May-13,"Decent pan asian, good to visit in families/ groups","My husband and I went to the Hill Road branch in Bandra, which my husband says is considerably smaller and less plush than the one in Delhi. The bandra one is in place of the Godrej Nature's basket store near Ray's Pizza. The art and accessories are eyecatching kitsch same as the ones in other branches but walls, ceilings are basically cement plaster painted over and look slipshod - as though they took over from Godrej nature's and basically put together the restaurant in couple weeks.I ordered asparagus grilled with sweet soya which was excellent. My husband ordered chicken thai basil in lettuce cups which he really liked. Next I ordered udon noodles recommended by our waiter - very disappointing, typical Indian spicy sauce flavours which were hard to discern and came with uncooked babycorn, the kind that can cause stomachaches. So I ordered some sticky rice (good quality) with veggies in black bean sauce. The sauce was quite nice and more delicate than my previous dish but didn't satisfy my noodle craving. So to play it safe I ordered a veg pad thai. I am not sure why Indian restaurants insist on adding every kind of veggie in a vegetarian Pad thai, it's not like a non- vegetarian one comes with chicken, fish, shrimp and lamb altogether!! Again it was decent but too saucy and not wholly satisfying.My husband meanwhile had ordered a grilled bassa in I think a hoisin sauce but it never came. Instead the waiter got the javanese style sole fish in spicy sauce that my husband did't want. After an hour and half into our lunch when my husband was basically twiddling his thumbs and picked a little bit at my dishes while I did my trial and errors, my husband gave up. It turned out the waiter forgot to enter his correct order this time. The bassa would have taken at least another 20 minutes to grill so my husband now frustrated just ordered a second helping of the thai basil chicken in lettuce cups - at least it was tried and tested.From his previous experiences at the restaurant in Khan market, Delhi my husband says the non-vegetarian food is better at Mamagoto's, more delicately made than the vegetarian food but that doesn't help me, a vegetarian. I think I'll wait for a chain like Wagamama's to finally show up here - classic, high quality fast-food Pan Asian for cheap. Meanwhile, I hear PingPong has India on the cards.In case you do go, go in a group so you can order a variety of dishes and don't feel bad wasting. I came home with several packed leftovers.Dear Indian restauranteurs trying to break into the pan Asian restaurant scene - please learn to be delicate yet flavourful with your sauces - we are no longer the sort of people who think New Yorker's is Mexican! Also please avoid adding every imaginable veggie in your veggie entrees - it takes skill to figure out which veggies pair up well with which sauces and spices and limit the veggies to a couple!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4155450-Reviews-or290-Mamagoto-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mamagoto, Andheri, Mumbai

On our recent visit we had once again a great experience and some awesome food. Their raw papaya salad and Thai green curry were especially very good.

Food here is always made with lots of love. The service has been always good. This time we were the last person to leave around 11:30 at night because we reached late but they never came and asked us to leave. Every staff is courteous and smiling always which makes the food experience even better. This time they added a little techie thing where you can order food from the iPad(tablet) menu.. which was a nice touch,I ordered Pan fried noodle, Mix fried rice, prawn with chilli basil sauce and Asian pickled peppered chicken for appetizer… and everything was just perfect. The smell, the texture, the temperature was just perfect. Its like a food lover’s paradise.I would love to visit their kitchen next time (if they allow me finger cross) and post some more photograph on my blog.

10,6-Aug-18,SHOCKINGLY RUDE AND UNREASONABLE TREATMENT BY THE MANAGER!,"Just had the MOST TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE imaginable at Asia Kitchen, Palladium, Mumbai!I called the restaurant in the evening to say that I was visiting the restaurant, and that I had 2 different types of Vouchers (Citibank and HDFC) and to check if that was OK. I gave the serial number of one set and was told it was fine. I said that the others were eVouchers and was told that if they were valid for Speciality Restaurants, they would be accepted. I made a reservation. Then I called back later to say that I had booked on Easy Diner, so the direct booking could be released. The person on the other side asked me if there was any special occasion, and i said that it was my mothers birthday.The person I spoke to was PUNKAJ SUBBA - claimed to be the Manager.When I got to the restaurant, I gave the eVouchers and the Gift Vouchers to the Manager - the same person I had spoken to. We then sat down and ordered our food. As the food started arriving, the Manager came to me and said that I could EITHER use the eVouchers OR i could use the Gift Vouchers OR I could use the Easy Diner promotion.I was SHOCKED because the very same person had been told when I did the reservation that I would be using 2 different types of vouchers and that I had booked on Easy Diner, and had not said anything about it. Even when I walked into the restaurant and handed over the vouchers, he never said anything. Only after we had started the meal, he came out with this incredible statement putting all kinds of restrictions on what had already been confirmed to me!!!!It seems that his only intention was to embarrass and humiliate me in front of my guests, and he absolutely succeeded!!!I also wonder why he asked if we were celebrating any special occasion, if he had no intention of wishing my mother, let alone giving her a small cake which almost any restaurant would have done under the circumstances! It is not as if I asked for anything…… but it is so ridiculous to first ask if there was an occasion, and then not say a word about it!!!Eventually he very grudgingly and condescendingly agreed to use both the vouchers, though he refused to give me the benefits of my Easy Diner booking!!!It is shocking that a so called manager should harass and embarrass a Customer in this way, specially when he confirmed that both vouchers could be used, and also was aware that I had an easy diner booking. WHY COULDN’T HE HAVE CALLED ME ANY TIME BEFORE THE MEAL INSTEAD OF HUMILIATING ME AFTER WE HAD STARTED EATING?????In any case WHAT LEGAL RIGHT did he have to refuse me, when the eVoucher clearly states in the terms and conditions that:(a) MULTIPLE Gift Vouchers can be used against one bill(b) Gift Vouchers CAN BE CLUBBED with ongoing promotionsHe also knew that I had booked with a 15% discount on Easy Diner, and I reconfirmed that when I walked in and he never said anything about it????I think the behaviour of your manager was not only RUDE, ARROGANT and HUMILIATING, but was also ILLEGAL and in total contravention of the Terms and Conditions (attached).",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d7059454-Reviews-or10-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, Goregaon, Mumbai

Went really well the the fried rice- Chicken Pad Thai Noodles - A little Gluggy and was just an ok dish; could give it a pass next time.For the Drinks-- Cherry Daiquiri - Really Loved this One..A yum drinkTried a Cambodian Cooler - This wasn’t a great drink at all; felt like a juice instead of a cocktail.Overall, it is a good place to try out for some good Authentic Asian Cuisine.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d7059454-Reviews-or10-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, Goregaon, Mumbai

I have been to this place twice and it does not disappoint me at all (Except for the Lemon-Coriander Soup which is abysmal). I have had all sorts of rice here, with the General Tao’s Chicken, which is an absolute chicken recipe, cooked and made well. The Eight Treasure Soup was good and so was the Guava Punch; I recommend going for the Asian Pickled Pepper Chicken with the Goreng Rice variant (Veg or NonVeg), We also had Dumplings & definitely only recommend the chicken basil, since the veg basil were kinda deal breakers. The ambience and décor inside and the seating is limited but comfortable.

20,9-Aug-17,Veggies can DEFINITELY give a miss to this place,"Opted for this Chinese restaurant for Friday dinner with office colleagues.It is authentic Chinese restaurant by Mainland China. So one can expect similar food taste.We ordered both veg and non-veg food. Since I am vegetarian, will review it for the same.Dimsum platter was really awful, neither tasty nor appealing to eye sight. Other potato starter was simply okie.Burned chili garlic rice was nothing as the name suggest instead it was just like plain pulao.Another main course with gravy was edible though.And what I learnt from non-vegetarian friends that their food too was not that great.What made the entire experience really unpleasant was cashier and staff's rude behavior.We paid our bill using credit card. Since one of us needed change for Rs.2000 and asked the same to the person behind the counter, initially he simply denied it. On insisting he just went and came back (which we could see clearly) and turned us away saying they don't get any cash payment.. hard to believe.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d7059454-Reviews-or30-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, Goregaon, Mumbai

40,12-Sep-16,Asia Kitchen - Mainland China at Oberoi Mall,"Visited this place for dinner as we had heard good things about the food.Started off with the dim sum ""platter"" which consisted of only 6 dim sums They were quite tasty though.The crispy spinach leaves are also worth a try. Very unusual.Followed this with the Konjee Crispy Lamb, Dymanite Prawns, General Tao's chicken, stir fried vegetables, fried rice and for the sweet we had the honey noodles and ice cream, the lychees with ice cream and the sizzling brownie.All the food was very good. Go for the ""Dynamite Prawns"" if you like mustard - else avoid.The fried rice - mixed meat it was called I think - was excellent. It also had some prawns in it.We thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes.Just a suggestion : The least you can do is have some ""Khimchi"" on the table which customers can snack on while waiting. The peanuts in soya sauce were awful and does not go down well in a place like this.The sweet portions were also rather small.The place was pretty full up - no surprise being in a mall.Service was also pretty good but could be improved.All in all, a very pleasant experience.You get a 20% discount (approx) if you get a ""Nearbuy"" voucher.Final cost worked out to just over Rs. 1000 per head - but no complaints as we were stuffed.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d7059454-Reviews-or40-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, Goregaon, Mumbai

I had a Kingfisher Ultra Max bottled beer. And then I decided that I wanted to focus on a Thai meal comprising Prawn Tom Yum soup and Thai red curry with steamed rice. Both dishes were authentic and tasted great. For dessert we were tempted by the advertising for lychee + ice cream which looked impressive. It was served on a bowl of dried ice. The only slight disappointment was the size of the portions - 6 lychees and a large scoop of ice cream shared between two...The restaurant is quite lively with an open kitchen where you can see the many chefs in action. There was also a huge TV screen for those who want to follow the cricket.

40,15-Jun-16,Asian Fine Dine in a mall!,"Ambience – Pleasant and warm interiors, with tables not so close that you can be entertained even if you are alone, but not so far that you feel lonely.Value for money – If it weren’t for the taxes, would be better value for money. Our bill came to Rs. 2000 (including Rs. 400 in taxes and service charge)Ordered for:1. Vegetable Dimsum Platter2. Vegetable Spring Rolls3. Assorted Vegetables in Chilli Basil Sauce4. Ginger & Capsicum Fried Rice5. Rambutan with Vanilla Ice cream6. Guava & Peach Iced Tea7. Hot Lemongrass Honey TeaDetails:We were here for dinner on a weekday. The restaurant was surprisingly crowded. which is a good thing, for them, not necessarily for us.We were seated at a table quickly. The service was especially quick, which made us wrap up our dinner in one hour.The food was delicious, but we would have been happier with slightly larger portions. Seeing the amount we ordered, you’d assume we were quite full, but alas, we were hungry for little more.Now to describe the food:Vegetable Dimsum Platter – 9 tiny pretty dimsums were served in a large platter, making them look even smaller than they actually were. There were three types, Veg Sui Mai, Spinach & sesame, and Veg Chilli basil. All were flavourful and went very well with the sauces given. They were soft, hot and fresh.Vegetable Spring Rolls – 6 spring rolls (cut into half) were served. They were crisp and hot, but lacked any basic distinct flavor. They were neither good, nor bad.Assorted Vegetables in Chilli Basil Sauce – Carrots, broccoli, peas, and few more vegetables in a spicy thick sauce. It was too spicy (as I was already warned) about and went well with the rice.Ginger & Capsicum Fried Rice – This was a let-down, as it actually looked like plain white rice mixed with barely sautéed ginger and capsicum pieces. Not the kind of fried rice that we can eat just by itself.Rambutan with Vanilla Ice-cream – This was very visually appealing since it came with an awesome dry-ice smoke which lasted till after we finished our dessert. The fruit was fresh and sweet. The vanilla ice cream was, well, vanilla ice cream.Guava & Peach Iced tea – This was delicious and sweet. It was a little sweeter than I would have liked it, but am not complaining.Hot Lemongrass Honey Tea – Don’t know why, but I was head over heels with this. Really loved it a lot. It was very fragrant, nice and sweet and hot. And a sufficiently large portion.Service:The service was quick, but hurried. Seemed like they were in a hurry to send us away. The servers seemed new, and spilt food while serving. My name is The Big Bad Foodie, but I don’t think I look it, that they should be scared. The beverages came after we finished our appetisers.Verdict:An overall nice meal, super quick, not too heavy, a bit pricey, but not a bad choice either. I would surely make a trip again for some more of that delicious Lemongrass tea.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d7059454-Reviews-or50-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, Goregaon, Mumbai

I also had the Baked California Rolls and they were yummy. I also had Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup and it was OK. I thought it lacked the taste of Coriander as well as Acidity.For Mains, we had Vegetables in Red Thai Curry Sauce, which came with a bowl of Rice.

40,19-Dec-15,Good food served fast for a reasonable price,"This restaurant reminds me og ""Pei Wei"" in US; however, this restaurant has a lot larger selection of dishes. We ordered Soups (Chicken Tom Kha, Hot and Sour, Chicken Tom Yum and Sweet Corn Soup); all were good, I really enjoyed the coconut flavor of the Tom Kha (a little more spicy than what I would have liked). For starters we had Chicken Satay and Chicken Shumai. I loved the nicely steamed Shumai. The cating on the Satay was great but the additional sauce was not not that good. For main course we had Pan Fried Noodles with Cantonese Chicken topping; it reminded me of Shirmp with Sizzling rice I find in US. Same great taste with crispy noodles instead of sizzling rice (sizzling rice is better in my opinion). Vegetable fried rice was good but again a little spicier for my personal taste. Stir Fried Chicken with Chillies/Garlic/Hot Basil was OK; almost felt like they were using the same base for all their dishes with dark brown sauce. Overall, a good experience for a relaxed dinner with very good selection of Asian (non-Indian) flavors.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d7059454-Reviews-or60-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, Goregaon, Mumbai

They dont reserve table on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d7059454-Reviews-or70-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, Goregaon, Mumbai
40,23-Oct-15,"Delicious food, excellent service, must try nasi goreng rice","I am never disappointed with their food. I ordered nasi goreng chicken fried rice after reading positive opinion for this particular item on all food websites. Its an Indonesian specialty. I reckon this is the best fried rice in their menu after trying various options. Thereafter, I ordered it on 3 consecutive weekends and taste was consistently good each time. The nasi goreng veg fried rice was also equally good. Not very fond of Chinese but mainland China is too good and I love it each time I visit. Its priced slightly higher but the extra you pay is totally worth for the taste they give.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d7059454-Reviews-or70-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, Goregaon, Mumbai

40,28-Jan-15,Simple and delicious food,"If BBC in the same mall is one big perk of staying in the neighborhood, MC isn't far behind. It's amazing how many times we keep going to Mainland China to satisfy our nightly cravings for hot, comfort Chinese food! Last night was one such time and off we went to the one in Oberoi Mall. It was a simple but delicious meal. We shared a chicken tom-yum soup that was perfect for my sore throat and the sudden drop in night temperature. This was followed by wok-tossed chicken noodles for me and fried Japanese style udon noodles for the hubby; both quite yummy with the right flavors--comfort and reasonably priced Chinese food at its best if I may say so! The service was prompt and nice. My noodles were getting cold and even before I asked the waiter, the observant manager himself came and took it away for reheating. The ambiance was quite cosy as well, despite the mall-location.All in all, this place is very good for a quick and tasty simple Chinese meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d7059454-Reviews-or70-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, Goregaon, Mumbai

20,14-Feb-19,Read before visiting,"We decide to to try Mainland Chinas Asia Kitchen on Valentines day for dinner since we had many great meals at Mainland China over the last 15 years … sad to see it go we were optimistic to try its new avatar. Guessing it would be busy on the 14 of Feb for dinner we made a booking over the phone. Made it there only to be greeted by a cocky, over-smart manager who very condescendingly seated us as a table, almost like he was doing us a favour. Not the welcome we expected.Once seated the service was better, waiters were polite and efficient but quite unable to help any queries. Blank stares were the only answers i got. The food got to our table quite quick despite the crowd. The starters we ordered included a prawn tempura sushi roll, dynamite prawn and pickled chicken. The pickled chicken and dynamite prawns were excellent. The sushi was well below average/borderline terrible.For mains we orders the Singapore crab, general taos chicken and truffle rice. The crab was okay at best not authentic. Wouldn’t repeat. The chicken was good. The rice was just awful, more like a risotto. Not at all oriental in any way. Complete misfit. Sticky and stodgy. The portions were quite contrasting, the chicken starter, prawn starter, chicken main & rice were decent but the sushi and crab portion were really tiny, barely enough for 2 to share. both of them are a definite miss.The ambiance is nice but its not somewhere you go for the ""THE AMBIANCE"". Looked great, very comfortable and functional but got quite noisy due to the open kitchen and the lack of fabric furnishings. Its a functional place to eat and move on, not the kind you would sit, chat over a drink with your meal, you would typically visit just for the meal.Pricing is reasonable when you see the menu but after seeing the quality of food and portions, its not value for money or money well spent. average dish is ₹400-500+. and an average table of 2 will require 4-5 dishes at a minimum.Would I recommend it ? yes its worth a TRY if your looking for something a bit(only a bit) different. Instead of going back to the same asian restaurants this simply serves as a change.Would I go back ? Don’t think so …. sadly I’ve tried it once and I doubt i’ll return unless I read great things.Bottom line is that the food is nothing to write home about, the service is so so, the ambiance 'okay’ and for the money you pay you can get better.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or20-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune
50,9-Feb-19,Delicious food,"It's rare to find such well prepared food, nowadays. In one word it's delicious. The green Thai curry dumplings and the snicker cake for dessert are a must have. The spicy food is really spicy.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or20-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune
50,29-Jan-19,Great food for everyone,"There were so many dishes it was hard to choose, all of them very tasty but perhaps worth special mention are the veggie sushi, the great soups, loved the noodles and the fish. Something for everyone and a great sharing meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or20-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune
50,28-Dec-18,Asia Kitchen by Mainland China - A real boon for Pan Asian food lovers,"From an array of beverages and appetizers, whether it is their Sushi Rolls or Dimsums, Asia Kitchen will leave you asking for more and then all the more. The place bears the widespread culture and cuisine of Asia with a young, casual and refreshed look.The decor of the place is bright and vibrant and has a wooden touch to it.If the paitings on the wall will drop your jaw to awe, you can't be excited enough to see the open live kitchen, The place is indeed happening in all possible ways.After many success stories at Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru & Chennai, Asia Kitchen by Mainland China recently opened their doors in Dhole Patil Road, Pune and I was invited for an exclusive preview of the place. Given below is a brief about some of the lip smacking dishes I got to try:-MOCKTAILS:-Orangepiroskha (160 INR):- A fizzy Orange Juice with fresh orange chunks and mint leaves was a perfect tangy start to the night.Malaya Spiced Melon(160 INR):- A drink that has watermelon chunks, fresh ginger and lemon fizz somewhere felt incomplete to my tastebud as if something was missing from the recipe of wow.SUSHI (NIGRI):-Tuna Nigri (145 INR):- This has restored my faith in Pink I would say. Or It could be the fishes, Having Chicken as my second Non-Vegetarian Preference, Prawns has always been my first. But That's it, as I was still exploring this never ending world of fishes and Seafood. Untill this slice of Raw Fish would just made me reconsider my thoughts about Fishes or Sushi.SUSHI (ROLLS):-Blue Rice Sushi (445 INR):- Heard so much from the Instafoodies about this Smurf like looking rice was enough to go gaga about this whole recipe but it turned out that the rice is actually dyed with the butterfly-pea flower and the taste of the rice simply multiplies with Salmon, Avocado, Cucumber and Cream Cheese.DIMSUMS:-Asian Cottage Cheese Tortellini (225INR):- Asian Cottage Cheese Tortellini is simply a bomb of flavours. The rich creamy curry with a strong aroma and flavour of coconut simply sets an example for the fusion of Asian and Italian Cuisine.Chicken Wraps in Pakchoy Sichuan Broth (245 INR):- Pakchoy or Bakchoy is a type of a chinese cabbage and as the name suggests the recipe was exactly a lip-smacking warp of Chicken Mixture in Pakchoy. Fun Fact - Reading some more of what a pakchoy can be used for, It is nothing but a experimental instrument in the kitchen I swear.APPETIZERS (VEGETARIAN):-Crispy Lotus Stem (395 INR):- All of a sudden reminded of a one I had at Post 91, This was no different but what else could you expect more from the recipe. It was good as it was supposed to serve as an appetizer, It was sweet, crispy and tangy at the same time.APPETIZERS (NON-VEGETARIAN):-Pink Pepper Prawns (495 INR):- I've come out as a habit that whenever and wherever I see Prawns, I am bound to set expectations and I'm glad to say that Pink Pepper Prawns turned out to be one of those satisfactory recipes that couldn't disappoint me with the taste. Crunchy from the outside and yet so soft from the inside, I couldn't stop to eat more and more of them.MAINS (NOODLES):-Japanese Wheat Noodles (395 INR):- I have been struggling big time to find my love for Noodles, Been added to my diet plan 6 months ago, I'm still having troubles to fall in love with it like my other foodie friends would. But this would be one I guess should be considered for bringing out a perfect combination of health and taste when you know it was tossed in exotic zucchini, bell peppers, spring onions and a handful of fried garlic on top.MAINS (VEGETARIAN):-Water Chestnut, Corn and Potatoes in Roasted Chilli Sauce (375 INR):- This has be to a perfect mains as they call it, The spicy mix of all the ingredients just bring out an amazing taste to your table and It went so well with the Jasmine Rice. The bite into Water Chesnut just brought about all my childhood memories from the past and it was just a feeling I can't express in words.MAINS (SEAFOOD):-Steamed Pomfret in Japanese Miso Chilli Sauce (845 INR):- A discussion started on the table of how they were not happy with the taste of The Pomfret while I was binge eating it all till the last bite of it and I was all about how tender a fish could be. Soon, We were informed that the taste or the aroma was all about the of the presence of Miso Chilli Sauce in it.DESSERTS:-Snicker Cake (295 INR):- A soft cake coated with melted snickers bringing out the intense flavour of chocolate with a lots of crushed peanut, Oh bouy, I only wonder what would happen if a they add a thicker layer of Snickers in the Inside?Coconut Dumpling (225 INR):- These were very much the Asian version of our desi modaks with the dash of date syrup and palm sugar, and were completely game for a dessert.Asia Kitchen is the boon for Pan Asian food lovers. I'm afraid they're gonna steal the thunder of all the exciting restaurants in Pune very quickly and shall be popular so soon. I would most certainly recommend for a dinner with friends or family.Thank You Sharvari Manakawad and Milestone for extending the invite and Thank You Team Asia Kitchen by Mainland China for hosting us.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or20-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune
50,23-Dec-18,An amazing experience,"Mainland China has already etched a place in people’s hearts with their Chinese cuisine, offering a near perfect dining experience. With 25 years of experience under their belt, or chef’s hat, Mainland China is starting all over again, introducing their younger sibling to the world.Asia Kitchen by Mainland China presents to you an adventure into a widespread culture and cuisine of Asia with a young, casual and refreshed look. After revealing the innermost secrets of China’s vast and extensive cuisine; Asia Kitchen promises to be a revelation of sorts taking connoisseurs through the sprawling kitchens of Far East from Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia to Malaysia, Burma, Korea and of course China.The master chefs at Asia Kitchen curate a fast, casual experience through their cooking techniques of tossing, steaming, frilling and eventually, stirring the palates and souls of many energetic diners. The menu from Asia Kitchen by Mainland China is extensive and ranges from sushi to dim sums, to baos and noodles to Asian desserts.The place has a very vibrant ambiance with mood lighting and comfortable seating and the open kitchen along one side of the restaurant not only gives an insight into the workings of the kitchen but also adds a sensation of openness to the place.I was called for a pre-launch preview of the place and I was extremely impressed by the overall experience.CocktailsWhile all the cocktails on the curated menu looked tempting, I could only try the Pearl String thanks to my sugar restrictions. Made with Rosé sparkling wine with a dash of fresh ginger, it was extremely refreshing with a slight zing to it. The sugar-free version was much better in my opinion as it allowed the other flavors to shine through.AppetizersThe Tuna Nigiri was extremely fresh and was packed full of flavors. Nigiri is a type of sushi made of thin slices of raw fish over pressed vinegared rice and the tuna slices added a nice color balance to the dish. Served on a drizzle of spicy mayo, the overall dish presented a pretty picture. Dipping it in the accompanied soy sauce lends a wonderful saltiness to the bite. #YumYumThe Blue Rice Sushi had salmon, avocado, cucumber slices and cream cheese. Being a traditional sushi, as opposed to a nigiri or a sashimi; the blue rice sushi had the fish and sliced veggies tightly rolled inside nori sheets and covered with the rice. The acidity of the vinegared rice was balanced by the creaminess of the avocados and the cream cheese while the cucumber provided some crunch and coolness. The pickled ginger, soy sauce and wasabi provide an added dimension of flavor to the dish. #DeliciousDeliciousThe Red Curry Shrimp Dumplings had a real thin envelope covering the stuffing which really helped bring out all the flavors.The Pink Pepper Prawns was a crackling dish. A “Plain Jane” in looks, the prawns packed a wonderous punch. The perfectly cooked prawns were soft to the bite and yet retained the crunch of the coating. A very well-balanced dish. Only feedback – they could have used more microgreens on top, it could have added a little bit of freshness to the dish. #HighlyRecommendedMainsThe mains served to us at the soiree was a myriad variety of dishes covering vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian from the South East Asian region.The Water Chestnut, Corn & Potatoes in Roasted Chili Sauce and the Spiced Chicken with Roasted Garlic went well with the Steamed Jasmine Rice and the Edamame Red Rice although I personally found the chili levels in both dishes to be on the lower side. Loved the bite of the water chestnut which complemented the softness of the corn and potatoes while the chicken chunks were cooked to perfection.Considering my dietary restrictions, I could only sample a bite or two of these dishes however I fell in love with the Japanese Wheat Noodles. As is evident from the name, made from whole wheat, these are decidedly healthier than the usual noodles made with all-purpose flour or maida. Thin noodles tossed with juliennes of bell peppers and other veggies, this was one healthy yet delicious portion. Who says healthy food can’t be delicious? #YumYum #HighyRecommendedHowever, the showstopper of the evening was undoubtedly the Steamed Pomfret in Japanese Miso Chili Sauce. An entire pomfret [yes, an entire freakin’ fish] basted and cooked in miso chili sauce and served whole in a bed of the same. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the tender white meat went well with the jasmine rice with a drizzle of the miso chili sauce for some moisture. You’re likely to choke on the tiny bones so need to exercise some caution there.As the evening progressed, the music got increasingly loud for my preference while the service just couldn’t keep up with the orders flowing in from every table. While the volume is more of a personal preference, I believe a setting like Asia Kitchen would do better with lower decibel levels to enable dinnertime table conversations.From an array of beverages and appetizers such as Sushi Rolls and Dim sums to authentic Burmese Khow Suey, Thai Curries & Nasi Goreng, Asia Kitchen will leave you asking for some more and then even more. After having served successfully in Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru & Chennai, Asia Kitchen by Mainland China has opened its doors on 1st December in Pune at Dhole Patil Road.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or20-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

40,12-Nov-18,A Great Dining Experience,"Visited the place after almost seven years. With family for dinner. The food quality as well as quantity came up to our expectations. But was a bit disappointed to see some of my old favorite items missing. For example ""rice cooked in lotus leaves "" was missing.One observation. Ordering food from scrolling down on a tab is a bit painful. At a time you can see a very limited number of entries, and you need lot of patience to go through the whole menu. Old fashioned printed menu is much easier to handle , and you can select after scanning all the items.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or20-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

40,22-Jun-18,Very very good catering for home-party!,"We are habitues at this restaurant. Their executive lunch is so much a value for money that we routinely entertain our friends here. The choice is enormous; the quantity is so large that we senior citizens always have to carry a doggy-bag home; the soups and vegetarian entrees are superb. This is a refreshing change for my vegetarian wife who is habitually short-changed in all eateries.However, we were pleasantly surprised when they agreed to cater to a small soiree and dinner at our home. The staff including a chef and a bartender, arrived an hour before the guests, with all cooking and serving dishes, set up the kitchen and dining area and served the appetizers fresh from the steamers and fryers, mixed cocktails from ingredients we provided, and served each guest with their individual preferences. They were bowled over as were we, when the main courses were sent just before the time we had set for dinner and at the end, at dead of the night, they cleaned up the kitchen and took the substantial left-over food we declined to keep, away; leaving everything clean and serviceable. The costs were comparable to other caterers, but the service, abundance of items, quality and quantity of food, made the meal and evening memorable. You have to try them to believe! The four-star is from an academic belief that there is always room for improvement.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or30-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

Excellent dimsums and close to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The staff is courteous and accommodating and the manager is very kind. You will never lack variety here even if you order a la carte. Their drinks are good and reasonably priced.The ambience is warm with pleasant colors. Their bathrooms are very clean. We go to Mainland China often and enjoy the flavors. They even serve crab on the buffet. We love Mainland China at Dhole Patil road Pune, and in Bombay too!

50,14-Nov-16,Good pan-Asian cuisine,"After a long hiatus, we had a family reunion to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Being a large group with different food choices, we narrowed down our choice to the all you can eat lunch buffet at Mainland China. We weren't disappointed a bit.The restaurant now offers a wide selection of pan-Asían fare in addition to the regular Chinese dishes.We started with a customized bowl of Vietnamese Pho, the traditional winter soup. The starters were served on the table, one after another :Malay satay, Chinese Dim sums, wontons, shrimps steamed in Pandang leaves, vegetable fritters etc. We were spoilt for choice.The main courses also offered endless choices, mee goreng, Thai curries, Chinese fried rice, Korean khimchi and so on. I, for one, ate crabs to my heart's content.One soft drink is complimentary per person. Also they offered a complimentary champagne bottle and birthday cake to help us celebrate.We shall remember our lunch for a long time to come. As they say in Spanish, barriga llena corazón contento.

30,16-Sep-16,Declining Place,It used to be very good. Have been a customer for about 5 years. The food was pretty authentic and tasty till two years back. Especially Szechwan. Things have changed. The authenticity has gone. Very Indian-Chinese now. Maybe that's what sells. Like Chinese cuisine in Delhi. Water and sauce have been replaced by oil and grease. Very disappointing.I give this restaurant another 2 years before it closes down. There is a general air of despair about it.

20,13-Sep-16,Best Forgotten,"Lunch today at Mainland China, Dhole Patil Road, Pune, was best forgotten. The two soups we had were tolerable but not worth the price. The three main dishes (described as Hakka vegetable noodles, prawns in white sauce and vegetables in brown sauce by the staff) ranged from tasteless to appalling. Two components dominated the prawns and vegetables: sliced garlic and cornstarch. One was a gloopy mess of white gravy and the other like a thick brown stew. How come this brown? Cheap soya sauce and cornstarch, I would guess.We would have had some fish but they serve only bassa (tasteless frozen fish from Vietnam) or overpriced Bekti. And this from a restaurant chain from Calcutta where good fish is highly prized. Are you listening, Mr Anjan Chatterjee?The staff were very friendly: Sangi from Reception was particularly helpful. But no one seems to have trained the waiters not to hold a water jug by the spout, to serve from the left and not right across the almost empty table, and so on.The bill for two including one glass of fresh-lime soda came to over Rs.2000.This is all sad because Mainland China used to serve acceptably good Chinese food (we have had some good meals there in the past).The Chinese on their mainland are fortunate not to have to eat this kind of food. We decided we have that privilege too -- never again, Mainland China!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or70-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

I reserved a round table for 10 and when we arrived at stipulated hour it was not ready. We had to wait for 15 mins before we were set. We all placed the order and mine came wrong.

40,26-May-16,Hidden Service Charges,"Visited Mainland China at the City Point, D P road, Pune for lunch yesterday around ! pm. We were three family members, and being a working day my son, on a business trip to Pune had taken some time off for lunch with parents. So we went for the option of ' Unfixed menu lunch "" and not the La carte option so as to finish the lunch in reasonable time.Every thing was going on fine with the soup and starters etc, till we asked for the fresh lime soda/water to be brought for the three of us. One waiter on duty was given specific instructions about these being sweet or salty, with soda or water and cold or at room temperature. It took two or three reminders and more than 25 minutes to get these. But that was not all, the waiter had mixed up the salt/sweet or soda/water and cold/room temperature combinations and had to take them back. we had to give fresh instructions to another waiter to get them right in due course of time.The food and preparations of dishes were very fine and no complaints there.Now the bill for payment was brought and before paying it I noticed that besides the usual VAT and Service tax and Swacchh Bharat cess, a sum of Rs. 118/ i.e 10% of our net food bill of Rs. 1185 had been charged as service charges. When asked about it from the Floor Manager on duty at that time, around 1430 hrs, said this is for the service charge. He was quite indifferent and nonchalant about it, saying that we charge this in all our branches all over India.Though shocked by this response, I paid the bill. Both the bill and payment receipt for it are available with me.Is ii not an enforced tip being charged surreptitiously without mentioning it in the menu?Are the restaurants permitted to charge this?Left with a bitter taste, hidden service charges for poor service!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or100-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

Mainland has the most delectable starters ideally suited for the Indian Palete and there dim sums and Sui Mai's are particularly wonderful.The main course go for the Fried Rice and Noodles rather than the clay pot which I thought was a bit bland.....The honey noodles for desert wee very nice too....I think it is one of the best Chinese places to eat in Pune.....,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or110-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

40,21-Mar-16,Value-fo-money buffet,"I visited Mainland China yesterday; with my wife and daughter, age 6 years. This was our first visit to this restaurant. We like other restaurants owned by Speciality Restaurants. This resturant also passed the test (and taste!) with flying colours. The restaurant interior is beautifully decorated with Chinese theme. The replicas of Chinese terracotta soldiers at the entrance make a grand impression. The ambience was good. Since it was Sunday afternoon, restaurant was buzzing. We opted for buffet option over a-la-carte; as this was our first visit. Also we wanted to try more dishes.The starters were served at the table and you need to get soup, main course and desert from buffet counter. Buffet included four veg and four non-veg starters. The service was fast and food was delicious. We enjoyed dumplings, tofu, chicken lollypop (not the exact name of the dish), fried fish, crispy veges from the starters. After enjoying starters we were 'full', so tried small quantities of main course. Meat fried rice, crab gravy and dumplings in sauce (again not the exact names of the dishes) were good. There was good selection of deserts - Cheese cake, Tiramisu, fruits and honey noodles with ice-cream, which we liked the most. When we were about to finish, we were served with another desert which looked like chocolate cigars.The only down side was background music, which I felt was bit loud. Overall it was wonderful experience; with value for money. Special thanks to Mr. Pijus, who was very attentive and made our experience memorable. We'll definitely visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or110-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

Dimsums had a silver foil, we ordered veg Hakka noodles but got soggy chicken Hakka noodles, steamed fish was smelling and the menu said its sea bass but the fish served was Betki, chicken stir fry was served with the fat on.

30,1-Sep-14,"Fall in Standards, Rise in Prices!","I have been a regular of Mainland China since the 90's(not just this branch) and want the place to go further. However, MC is losing its touch. When MC had started, it stood out from the others. Now, it only stands out from the crowd in terms of price! No new creativity in the kitchen (Add something really new in the menu, plz) and management is regularly changed. The ambience is good and contemporary but old timers like me will agree that the previous ambience was better. Even the food used to taste better before. I no longer like my fav Siu Mai dimsums. Last week, I had them and they were a little pasty.If any MC staff does read this, please please do something about it. MC's menu's rising prices are not and should not be a indicator of customer popularity.I can go on and on about its food's declining standards and portion size, but I feel as a loyal MC customer, I should not criticize much!Also, it is obvious, but still- this place does not serve authentic Chinese food!!!

I am a regular at the Amanora location though I do frequent the Dhole Patil Road location. Absolutely the best of Chinese joints in India and trust me, I have eaten in most of the 5-star and 7-star restaurants. Every weekend, we argue over where to eat out and invariably end up in MC.

However that experience spoiled the mood so I got the dish packed . As they took care of us I decided not to complain about it.When I came home I found the dish was not the same dish. and since then both of us have bad stomach ache.Mainland china was one of my favourite restaurants. hence I sent feedback to the feedback@speciality.co.in on 28 march. I did not receive any reply. I sent follow up email on 4th april for which I got reply.

20,11-Mar-14,poor service and quality,My second visit to Mainland China Aundh was not satisfactory at all. The order of dishes came randomly as per the kitchens capacity.

Its not really very cramped but I would certainly prefer little more spread out table settings than what right now is. From food choices and taste, its good. Dish like Crackling Spinach needs perfection as otherwise its not tasty at all. As many times as I go there, I find same good taste. I am more of a brunch guy rather than dinner and probably visit 4 times a year but still always wants to go there. Place which I liked more than Mainland China is Ban Tao of Hyatt, Pune.

40,4-Jan-14,Yummy Food and Messed up Service!!!!,"The stand out fact about this review is that I was amazed to see all Speciality Restaurants Companies restros in One place. Right from Oh Calcutta to Sigree to Mainland China to many more were a part of one lane offering great Cuisine.My review tag line says different because this is the second Mainland China restaurant we went to after the one we visited in Aundh early 2013 and surprisingly all Pune MCs have a different taste pallete to the Mumbai MCs though Pune ones offer yummier food for sure!!!I have not given a 5 star and only 4, on account of poor and unplanned service both inside the restaurant and at the Valet. There were trainee waiters serving us on a anew years eve night who Eddie directions for everything where in some delivered the our ordered food to some other table. They were sweet but on such an important night you have to wow your customers with great service. The Valet was a mess and very poorly managed parking I must say. It's understood that on the 31st night you will tons of customers coming in and while you have limited parking space to absorb 50 cars at least there has to be enough staff as for all the restaurants there is a common valet. The worst that I have seen so far as one of the Valet drivers couldn't find space to bring my car inn once we were done with our dinner and left it outside at the main gate unlocked to get other cars.I think all Hoteliers and Restro owners better realise today's consumer expects great food and service, both.

Less on oil, fat for any of the health conscious people/senior citizens (except the desserts). Lots of vegetables in the food.Service - very good, especially the senior staff on the floor. The juniors need to brush up their english.Ambience - can get a little noisy, but that is no different than any other good restaurant in India.Value for money - is a little pricey, potions are not large.

The next try can be Roast lamb in Mahlak sauce. This was slices of lamb in a dark Mahogany colored sauce & large mushrooms. Super soft meat & awesome to taste overall. The eight treasure soup is really good and most of seafood tastes authentic, preserves the flavors and is not overdone or stinks which is typical in other restaurant.

20,23-Apr-13,"Overrated, noisy and expensive","We had high hopes based on other reviews. First, the room was barely a quarter full, but it had the harsh noise of a greasy spoon cafeteria in the lunch rush, and was so loud that all conversation at a table of three people was almost impossible. Second, the staff mixed up our order with another table's, then instead of serving the other table fresh food, scraped what they served us back onto the serving plate and brought it over to them. Third, the food was mediocre at best. The hot and sour soup was gummy with cornstarch, with very little seasoning. The Mongolian lamb appetizer arrived in a cloud of smoke, but ended up being strips of lamb soaked in some sort of starchy marinade, then grilled until grey. It was tender, but also gummy with cornstarch, and without any taste besides cornstarch and soy. The duck dish was shreds of meat floating in an unpleasant, oily sauce - not the luscious item described in the menu. The garlic/ginger fish was the best dish - standard issue basa, with an edible though underseasoned and underspiced sauce. At these prices and with these reviews we expected a far better meal.

40,20-Sep-12,"Big service improvement, excellent food","I reviewed this restaurant in August last year and true to my word we ate there again this September to celebrate my 41st birthday. It is a huge sense of relief that I can freely recommend Mainland China at Dhole Patil Road (Pune) again. The quality of service has become much better, the paid parking issue too has surprisingly been taken care off (free valet parking is available, at least for dinner) and the food is top notch. Service was competent and unhurried, food came in less than 10 minutes, was hot, fresh and well presented.

30,18-Sep-12,Good Food but a little noisy,"Had dinner with family at the Aundh restaurant. Food was good and portions were generous. It didn't leave any aftertaste in the mouth as is typical with most Indian Chinese joints so full marks for that. Only disappointment was the soup which was a little too watery for my liking. It was like drinking stock! We went early so did not have to wait but the restaurant got really crowded around 9 pm so its best to book a table. While the general ambiance is good, it was a bit too noisy. We had to speak up in order to have a conversation. Service was slightly slow but not too bad. For some reason they were rationing the cutlery.. we had to ask for forks and knifes a few times.Prices are on the higher side and those quoted on the menu card are exclusive of all the taxes.I have been to all three of the restaurants in Pune now and found the SB Road one the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or310-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

30,9-Sep-12,MC is one of the best place for Authentic Chinese Food but not so in Pune,"I have been a regular to Mainland China since 2004 and have visited this chain in Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Kolkata and Pune. It was the best place for my liking till I moved to Pune and been to the DP Road one. We had a lunch buffet on a weekend and was so disappointed with it that I stopped visiting Mainland China in Pune. Recently another outlet have started in Amanora Mall and we went there for an alacarte dinner thinking that probably the buffet was not so good because of mass production and alacarte would be better. We were proved wrong though. Most of the dishes were on the sweeter side even though we had ordered spicy dishes. We could feel that the quality of ingredients were good but not the taste. Ambienece, decor and service were excellent as usual but it lacked the main thing, tasty food. The only item that I found to be at par with other Mainland China was the Hakka Noodles.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or310-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

I had heard about this restaurant chain and was always keen on going to one.To begin with let me say that the food here is super awesome!! We have never had such good Chinese food in a long time.Having said that however, the service is not what you expect of such exotic restaurant chains. Clearly Mr. Anjan Chaterjee, please teach your staff to at least smile when they greet new guests. Basic etiquette!! And if that were not enough, the waiter says 5 minutes and comes back after 20 minutes and for that duration, there is no one to even to listen to our ""Excuse me!""-s.

And it is not one or two employees but all the attending staff who is not only courteous but also attentive and genuinely concerned about making sure that you enjoy your meal.I had ordered the lemon coriander soup and i didn't like the taste so i left it. Immediately the server asked me if the taste was not good and if he could do anything to make it better or if i wanted a replacement. No faking of emotions and no hint of just a formality. Genuine concern.I said no and then mid way through the meal another server came upto me and sought my feedback on the soup. I was impressed. My not liking the soup was communicated and someone higher up had taken the trouble of coming and asking me the problem.It didnt end their. They offered me free dessert (which i didnt eat because i would put on weight) and they didnt charge me for soup after all ( i did not ask it to be waived).Brilliant.

20,3-Jun-12,"Popular chain, Indian Chinese cuisne loaded with MSG","This is a very popular chain for Indian Chinese cuisine in many parts of India. The reason for its popularity is of course because it caters to the vast majority of Indians who think of manchurian, hakka noodles, sweet corn soup and spring rolls as Chinese, specially if it comes loaded with MSG (most Indians have no clue what this is).

50,6-Feb-12,"Amazing food, comforting ambience","The food is definitely a big big plus if you looking for some nice chinese food, but are also willing to spare some extra bucks.

40,11-Jan-12,"Yummy Chinese, great interiors.","Food is expensive but excellent at Mainland China. They start the service with serving some green tea; and placing kimchee salad & marinated cucumber, on the table. Wonton Platter, soup of your choice, peking duck, honey glazed lemon chicken with recommended rice/noodle (you can easily opt for spicier dishes; we prefer less spicy). Also, accompaniments as rice & noodles are also served in small & large portions. Alcohol & beverages are also served.Kids enjoy sweet & sour vegetables with crispy noodles for main course & honey noodles for dessert. Average Price for two (without drinks) Rs.1,800/- approximately.On one occasion they allowed me to bring a self-decorated birthday cake and on another they brought out a small pineapple cake when we were dining to celebrate my nephew's birthday.A good value for menu would be to opt for their weekday lunch buffet or the more elaborate sunday lunch buffet.

30,9-Jan-12,Disappointed,"Mainland is my absolute favourite restaurant and i rate their service as the best not only in the restaurant category but also in any service industry. However this visit to their Pune outlet turned out to be disappointing. They have added too much punjabi tadka to chinese recipes, so fried corn came with chopped onions, they had run out of asparagus, corn/water chestnut/brocolli came with sweet corn (almost looked like corn veg) instead of baby corn, dimsums were oversteamed. overall a forgettable experience but i have had much better meals so am assuming this is one time goof up.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or370-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

Not sure if this has impacted their quality of food and service.Four of us went for a lunch meal. While the restaurant was well packed, the attendant got us a seat pretty quickly. Once inside the buzz was nice. But the focus seemed to be on getting the guests to go for the buffet. To be fair the buffet was packaged attractively and most of the people had opted for it. When I asked for the a-la-carte option it was not well received. The recommendations for the food also did not sound very informative.

30,22-Nov-11,Falling standards. Disappointed.,"i have been a fan of Mainland China ever since i first ate at their Kolkata flagship about 5-6 years ago. I was thrilled when they opened an outlet walking distance from my parents' home in pune a few years ago and we have been enthusiastic diners ever since, celebrating many special occassions at either this outlet or their sister outlet next door - Sigri.However, the last two times we ate there have been disappointing to say the least. The restaurant seems to have added more tables to cash in on their popularity and as a result there is a terrible amount of chatter during the meal. Wait staff have probably not been proportionately increased or the quality and training has gone down dramatically because they even forget basic things such as condiments with your soup order. Most of the main courses are still good but a few that demand subtlety sorely lack the finesse such as the Broccoli in Garlic. Food was served at the table at breakneck speed and resulted in small spillages, once on the table and once on my relative's lap.Since I'm ranting, another point that has rankled since long is that given how much you pay for a meal, it seems petty that parking is charged even though the restaurant is located inside an office tower and is free of vehicles during dinner. Having said that, until a better Indian-Chinese restaurant arrives on the scene I guess I'll still end up there from time to time.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or380-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

Everyone seemed to be enjoying the food.We were too full to enjoy a dessert.Would try it again next time.

20,27-Dec-10,Disheartened with the service,"I had visited Mainland China,Pune, ICC TOWERS outlet on 25th December 2010, with my family which comprised of 2 children. I had reserved a table the previous day, when I had inquired with the person over the phone if there would be a Santa since it was Christmas day. The person told me that there would be a Santa for sure and that they were also to give complimentary cakes to all their customers. Since I had 2 children with me I had to ensure that their Christmas day would not be upset. They were so thrilled with the aspect of meeting the Santa. When I reached the restaurant and ordered food I asked the waiter about the Santa and he was not aware of the same. When I asked him to check out he came with a very weird excuse saying that the person who was to act as Santa had fallen sick. This was the most weird excuse from the most popular outlet Mainland China. My children were so disheartened that their day was ruined. Throughout the day they were rejoicing with the fact of meeting Santa. If I had been told about his earlier I had better places to go where they would have enjoyed with the Santa.I would like to let you know that please don't fool people around like this. The complimentary cakes which were to be served were also pure lies. Please ensure that this kind of idiotic things don't happen since your restaurant reputation will be at stake. Even otherwise I have read lots of unpleasant reviews about your outlet.And for the waiters, they don't speak good english.

Then we had the main course and if i remember correctly there was veg fried rice, hakka noodles, manchurian and one more dish, all were really tasty and sufficient for 6 people. One thing you have to note is that place is not cheap so expect to spend some more money then other chinese places but in our case we were not dissapointed on food so the money didnt pinch that much and neways ppl in india have good amount money ha hah a :)...so if you are in Pune surely try this place, you will surely like the place unlike some people who were really picky in the reviews....",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or390-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune
50,25-Nov-10,A must for good Chinese food,"Normally the Chinese food we eat in India is very Indianised. Authentic Chinese is nowhere close to this food.

40,18-Aug-10,Now thats what I call chinese food !!,At Mainland China you get Chinese food with the Chinese flavour unlike some other restaurant who serve you chinese dished made with Indian ingredients. Some may not like it as it tastes authentic chinese to a certain extend. The ambience is nice but its a little over priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or390-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune
40,11-Aug-10,Great Dining Experience,"Its a good thing that Mainland China accepts reservations and recommends it too. The place can be full and embarrassing if you arrived there with friends and colleagues to have a good dining experience.Anyway moving to the ambience, the restaurant has got what seem like terracotta warriors to greet you, perfectly lit for a nice evening, neither too dark, nor too bright, just perfect for a good evening. The place is relatively calm and you can choose isolated spaces or common areas.Moving to the menu and the food, I must say they have a variety of dishes, mostly non vegetarian, ranging from steamed dumplings to vegetables and rice / noodles. This is one of the few restaurants, where despite a long menu, the waiters are able to elaborately explain any menu item and if asked for a recommendation, they give a great one. We asked for a reco for starters and they suggested one with Bhetki fish. Their pepper sautee dishes are a trademark and a must try.On the flip side, it usually takes sometime, about 20 minutes before they start serving you, but on the bright side, once they start serving you, they take very good care. They are smart, sensitive, not very close to your table, but seem to magically appear just when you need them. The moment they see your plate emptying, they are there to serve you the remaining portions. If there are two non vegetarians and a vegetarian on the table, they have the sensibility of serving more of a vegetarian dish to the vegetarian person and yet not offend anybody.If you leave a note about the dining experience, they do send you an email later, thanking you for patronizing their restaurant and hope to see you again.To summarize, I loved the dining experience and their trademark pepper sautee dishes, but also would be great if the waiting time between ordering and eating, is reduced. Fantastic food and fantastic service, great place to treat clients and family.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or400-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

Its Andhra style chinese( nothing to with mainland chinese!) which even Indians and definitely foreigners should avoid.They gave the chopssticks open( not in paper cover), without a small stand to put while eating.

50,1-Jun-10,Nothing but the best - a deserving recipient of Times Food Award,"The food is mouth watering and it's Sichuan and not Schezwan here :). When they say that a dish is hot, take their word. Generally many restaurants under the pretext of making something hot and spicy either add a lot of Red Chilly powder or Black pepper. But Mainland China serves just the right ingredients with the correct quantity.The executive lunch is nice on the pocket costing less than 300 bucks per person and composes of Soup, starter, main course, rice and desserts - all in veg or non veg. The waiters are really nice. I have eaten all alone at this place many times since it was near my office and they never let me be alone. They used to come by every once and then, asking how was the food, what would I like and so on. The ambiance is nice and the food is excellent. I never thought I'd like to taste transparent soups, those which had no colors, but my perception changed completely with Eight Treasure soup and Dimsum soup. I also like the Darsaan very much - Honey coated flakes served hot with a scoop of vanilla icecream.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or400-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

50,8-Jun-09,Yummy chinese food,"This restaurant serves the most amazing and authentic Chinese food ever -- in fact, when we had guests who had travelled extensively in China, they were pleasantly surprised by its high quality !The ambience is very pleasant, and the room is spacious and well decorated. there is a very pleasant garden section, also.The greatest value is offered by their ""Unfixed Lunch"" menu, when, for a very reasonable price of Rs. 225.00 only, you are served a delicious spread of soup, main dish, rice/noodles and dessert - and you can choose each dish from a wide selection !My only gripe -- as its usually too much too eat, and too delicious to leave behind, they should allow us to take the left-overs home in a parcel.( After all, its a fixed amount which is served, not a buffet, and they will probably throw away what remains, so why not let us have it ?? ) This especially applies to children , who cant finish the generous portions, and yet would love to eat them later !!Still, especially for taking guests, its a great place !",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d782769-Reviews-or410-Asia_Kitchen_by_Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Asia Kitchen, City Point, Pune

A decent choice of 3 course meal that would leave you thinking - wish I could eat more!!The bills may be slightly on the higher side if you go in for a 3 course meal for a family with drinks, but if its just the Chinese, its fine. However, even the 3 course family meal with everything you need thrown in - is worth the indulgence and extravaganza.. Trust me, you would Never regret meals at Mainland China.

Be it the food or the service, they won't let you down at all. Food is top-notch with maintained authenticity to it. The place is located just opposite Infinity Mall and upon entering this lovely dining place you can notice the huge space. It's more of fine dining with a range of food options. They Al-a-carte as well as buffet style, so it's a personal choice with whatever is okay. When it comes to Asian food, they have great sushi options, mouth-watering dumplings, and scrumptious Thai delicacies. Also, they have introduced a new menu which I did try out and it was definitely one heavenly meal.Good portions to be precise, a single portion can be easily had by 2 people.Started off with few portions of ""Pan Fried BBQ Fish""""Lemon Grass Prawns""""Coriander Chicken"" This was the best.Even tried a range of dumplings and I have a thing for it anyways. Gotta recommend the ""Philadelphia Cheese Dumplings"" & ""Pan Fried Japanese Mushroom Dumplings"". Kudos to the chef for making such amazing food.The mains definitely had to tried and we had ""Lotus Leaf Rice"" accompanied by a decent portion of ""Chicken In Roasted Garlic Sauce"". Even tried a small portion of ""Singapore Style Fired Noddles with Bean Sprout"". A good amount of veggies, fabulous quantity, and the gravy complimented the rice and noodles. Worth it.We finished our meal on a very sinful and decadent note with a huge portion of ""Chocolate Dome"". Well presented and extremely well crafted.

The staff, especially the server Mr. Sanjeet ( Table No. 8) was quite helpful in suggesting various dishes. One requires distinct taste bud to have authentic Asian Cullineries. We started with as usual Sweet Corn Soup which was good and Corn Waterchestnut Dumplings. For main course, we ordered Lemon Grass Fried Rice, Exotic vegetable in Chilli Basil Sauce and Japanese Wheat Noodles. They were all in good portions and very tasty. In the dessert, Chocolate Dome with warm Chocolate Sauce was a treat to watch needless to say it was different and very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or30-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
10,29-Mar-18,We tried the lunch buffet,Heard a lot about the restaraunt so gave it a try. We went to R mall food court and tried this restaraunt. It was a disappointment to say the least. The starters were acceptable but the main course Fried rice and Chicken were STALE. Also the veg starter of fried potatao was filles with ginger for some reason. I am not too sure of the a la carte but pls do not try the buffet for 700Rupees.

40,27-Feb-18,Chinese New Year,I visited here on Chinese New Year on which I expected the place to be very busy however it wasn’t. I’m a very fussy eater so I struggled to eat here. I had duck rolls for starter which were really tasty and I had sweet and sour chicken for mains which was also very good however not enough to fill me up as I don’t eat noodles or rice. I then had the brownie for dinner which was extremely great and would recommend this desert. I wouldn’t recommend eating here if your fussy as they don’t offer any options for people like me. If you love Chinese food then I would visit as the people I was with loved it here.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or40-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

30,18-Nov-17,Authentic Chinese Food,The food is really authentic and taste great to a lot of people but certainly not to all.

30,27-Sep-17,Mainland China is now Asian Kitchen and Bar - not the same I am afraid!,"My son and I visited Mainland China at Sakinaka where we have dined more than once in the past and always enjoyed the excellent cuisine. This time however the restaurant is renamed to Asian Kitchen and Bar and the food, along with the decor and ambience, has suffered:/We started with an Eight treasure soup with chicken - which was surprisingly just ok, not great. The starters of Dynamite Prawn (ok) and soft shell crab (very good) were followed by Tempura Sushi roll (ok).For main course, the Truffle and Endamame fried rice with mixed meats was good as was the stir fried chicken in a sauce.On the whole the food was ok to good. But when you visit Mainland China anywhere in India what you expect is great food - always.

Wanna know where you can hog some of it in an actual chinese atmosphere? Well look no more, because Mainland China is the best place to visit to fulfill your cravings for Chinese food. Not to forget the place also offers some amazing Thai dishes. What I loved most about this place is that from the moment I stepped in, there was a vibe of China town around me. No kidding there. The beautiful writings and paintings on the walls with perfect lighting gave the place a warm and homely aura . The place is simply the one you should go for when you want to enjoy a hearty meal in peace with your friends, family and ofcourse with your umm.. date maybe?Moving on to the food. Here's something I'll tell y'll if you happen to visit this place. You HAVE to try out their Juicy Rambutan. They serve it to you in this huge bowl from which belches flamboyant white smoke appears to be coming out and THAT makes this simple yummy dish look so darn Classy! I have also tried their Sizzling brownie with hot Chocolate and its finger lickin' goodI really loved how every single dish was served to us by the staff in its actual way. They communicated with us really well , explained to us their best dishes when asked and helped us decide our order which turned out to be Incredibly Awesome!

The dishes no longer have the magic that they used to have. I eat regularly at the Andheri West outlet and it is no longer spectacular to write about.

30,14-Aug-17,PLEASE AVOID THE BUFFET AVERAGE FARE AND GO ALA CARTE,"This restaurant earlier called mainland china was the flagship restaurant in mumbai at saki naka, andheri east.The buffet was very famous with lots of varieties and excellent taste.Now the renovated version with completely different interiors and instead of chinese only now pan asian cuisine is available along with chinese dishes.The buffet was just average cut down to limited range and plates becoming smaller in size.If it is done to avoid wastage by customers then fine.Completely average fare.Quality as well as variety.The service is very good and that is the only consolation prize. Price is pocket friendly.The renovated restaurant is spacious and the brightness of the sun from the windows has disappeared in the renovated restaurant.Drinks are okay.The concept probably is new but looks like will not be a winner.The whole new set up was not required to cater to pan asian audience as in India,pan asian is still in nascent stage.Chinese is more popular and is the earning revenue source for most of the restaurants.I was a bit disappointed as they have kept the prices of buffet reasonable but variety and quality missing.The ala carte menu is good and offers a reasonable variety .Some of the dishes were good.chicken and fish in ala carte was good.Overall rating -Food Quality and Variety - Buffet average , ala carte goodFood Taste - Buffet average , ala carte goodHygiene - GoodService and Courtesy - Very GoodInteriors - Spacious and average in grandeurPrice - Buffet reasonable , ala carte reasonable and a little high on some of the dishes.Repeat visit - Definitely No.The earlier restaurant I feel was excellent and was the Big Daddy of Chinese food.There are better options available nearby or visit their andheri west mainland china outlet which is still excellent although service during weekends is slow..I have an emotional connect with this restaurant going there since 1995 and enjoying the excellent buffet ,even my foreign guests from germany,france,italy uk,hong kong uae,used to love this restaurant and repeat every second third day which was called mainland china at that time known for its excellent chinese variety.However feel bad to say that this pan asian concept is not going to work and they are likely to suffer losses if they continue with this concept.The corporate crowd will go for drinks and ala carte but family crowd will reduce for sure with global fusion restaurant chain just 5 minutes drive offering sumptuous buffet and larger variety and portions with a little extra price,being a hot favourite for their variety .Even there are some more newly opened options in the same area offering chinese food and better quality and variety at reasonable price.The other option is to go their mainland china andheri west outlet which is still excellent and has sumptuous variety and excellent in quality and taste although service at andheri west outlet is very slow on weekends.You have to change with the changing times but after proper research and study of market.Disappointed completely.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or60-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

We had also dined at the outlet in Kolkata.The food in all the outlets that we visited was just awesome. One must phone and check if they have a buffet, which is reasonable. The variety of dishes in the buffet is massive. One should take a round of the service area to see what the components of the buffet are before serving yourself so that you will get to eat more of what you like and not wind up taking what you don't like. It is only in the soup that the choice is restricted to vegetarian or non vegetarian. Starters are served at your table.This restaurant is full value for money.

30,23-Oct-16,Mainland China good but needs an infusion of innovation.,Mainland China has always been a good option in our quest for diverse cuisines. However I feel this chain has not changed.

30,15-Oct-16,Losing its charm,What once was the best chinese place to eat has now become the usual place - but the prices are the same - so when you want to spend so much then probably there are much better options now.

40,3-Oct-16,"Great food, great ambience, great service","Lovely place where you can still aspire for authentic asian cuisine. What I love about Mainland China is their ability to customise food as per requirement (in my case, non-spicy food) and yet being able to serve a tasty platter. Their dimsums are fantastic. The ginger capsicum rice is a must for us each time we go there. Mocktails are nice and desserts are ok. Maybe Mainland C should introduce more desserts in their menu. Their buffet is really value for money for lunch. Am so glad this restaurant did not ""indianise their chinese menu"".

They presentation as well as the taste of both the dishes was marvelous! Really authentic phad Thai which I'm definitely going to recommend. We also ordered veg dumplings, boiled rice and a chicken gravy for the Chinese guests and they loved it too. According to them, Mainland China serves food almost similar to their homeland.

30,7-Jan-16,Not quite as good as before,"Indian-Chinese is a fun concept and way better than the bland over-sweet gooey ""American Mall Chinese"" that has virtually no relationship with what people ACTUALLY eat in China! Indian-Chinese generally takes a lot of popular elements from Chinese cuisine and then spices it up to suit Indian tastes. For my money this works!Mainland China is somewhere I've been several times while visiting Mumbai and I would certainly go again. The concept would possibly be a little confusing for a first-timer, but basically, you are served a choice of starters and then you can visit the buffet yourself and, pretty much, eat more of what you've just been served.Buffets are not generally a great proposition, but this one largely works because the turnover of dishes is quite rapid. There's a nice selection of desserts too.My reason for saying ""not quite as good as before"" is a simple matter of cleanliness. Generally this is a very clean and well-presented establishment, but on the day of my most recent visit I thought the tables and buffet area were not as pristine as I had seen before. Not bad, but not special. For a buffet, I prefer ""special"" to ""not bad"". However, based on past experience I am willing to believe this was just an ""off day"" (not that a restaurant should ever permit ""off days"" - particular regarding cleanliness) and I will certainly go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or210-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Rather if other places are crowded in malls, I just step in to eat there knowing that the choices will be limited and the prices higher than other places that serve better Chinese food like China Gate. The starters are good but you never get squids. The noodles are just about okay and the menu is not really innovative any more. I think there is too much marketing around this brand when real foodies move on word of mouth. MLC is not a happening place anymore. Time for some real change.

The Lotus Leaf rice came delicately flavoured in a large leaf but what blew our mind was the Pan fried Spicy Fish. A perfect blend of spices and condiments and the whole fish served on a large platter.

10,25-Aug-15,EIGHT TREASURE SOUP WITH A PIECE OF GLASS,"We had ordered for Eight Treasure Soup – Chicken, we having the soup we have found a piece of broken glass in the soup on my last spoonful or last bite I bit on to something hard. When I pulled it out to our surprise it was a Shard of Glass. I'm Furious! If I were to have swallow this. The amount of damage it could have cause would life threatening. I have told the waiter as well the restaurant manager on the same. They informed me that they will look into the matter. So they have not charged me for the soup.How can such a well know restaurant be so casual and careless regarding the food which is being served. Even the quality of the food at your Sakinaka is not the value for the money.The tax Invoice no : 5396 on 15th Aug time 23:22, Table no : 6, Pax : 4 personsEven after sending the hotel a mail 'yourviews@speciality.co.in & ''feedback@speciality.co.in', they are least bothered to reply and give a feed backhope any of you all reading this review should be careful while dining at Mainland China - Sakinaka.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or270-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Tried the entire range of dishes on offer-both vegetarian and non vegetarian options. We were pleased at the quality of ingredients they used that added crunch and flavors to the dishes,no mean feat to achieve in a Chinese buffet menu. The prices were very reasonable and we were surprised to be offered everything from soup,starters,main course,rice n noodles and scrumptious desserts for around six hundred rupees plus taxes.

40,2-Aug-15,Excellent buffet,"I had heard a lot about the buffet at Mainland China but never really could get a table easily. The food is really good (as always).

40,29-Jun-15,Wide variety of Oriental fare,"This place not only serves Chinese dishes, but in fact a variety of Oriental fare. It was a pleasant surprise to us to know this.I being a fan of Japanese fare ordered their Miso soup which could not be called perfect, but those who ordered the Chinese soups were very happy. So hastily we reached to a conclusion that these people are jack of all dishes and master of Chinese.We just stuck to the Chinese fare but later learned that the dishes of other countries were also nearly authentic and we could have indulged into them without any fear.A word of caution - we would like to add here - be careful about the serving portion - it is slightly more than you can imagine. So order carefully.The ambience is very good and service friendly.This being a fine dining restaurant definitely is slightly harsh on the pocket.We never had any prior reservations but were able to get the table immediately - maybe we were lucky.Should be tried at least once - we can guarantee this, you won't regret.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or300-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

30,19-Jun-15,Disappointing...,"I have been to different Mainland China restuarants around India, but this one was disappointing. I have generally considered it as a fine dine , authentic Chinese resturant but, cant say the same for this experience. We ordered 4 starters, 2 main dishes between 4 of us and we struggled to finish. It wasnt the quantity though, it was the taste. Sauted mushrooms were flavourless and crackling spinach was too salty and sweet. Tofu was too oily. Fried rice felt like street chinese food and oriental sauce with veggies was average. Spicy garlic noodles were good but too dry. In the end, for the price we paid (approx Rs 900 per head), we went away dissatisfied. Its time, Mainland china authorities have a look at their quality before its too late.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or310-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
30,18-Jun-15,"Chinese yes, but service is lacking","We had to ask for more than one menu for our table, then we had to ask if we can order, then we had to ask if we can order more, etc. They seem to struggle with service, though the restaurant was only half full.The food is ok, spiciness just right. But why everything, really even the fried rice, must be totally infused in garlic is peculiar. It also means you often cannot taste the food because of the overpowering garlic. Also they don't know the concept of small portions - small should mean small - why waste food?",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or310-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

30,17-Jun-15,Good food and very good portions,"We visited Mainland China at Saki Naka for lunch on a Sunday. It normally has buffets on all days except Sunday. So we missed out on that. Since it was a rainy day the restaurant had quite a few empty tables and was comfortable and spaced out. We started with some excellent khimchi and jasmine tea which certainly helped whet our appetite. For starters we had tofu plate, crackling spinach and marinated mushrooms. The mushrooms emerged as a clear favourite. Main course was exotic vegetables in chilli basil sauce along with fried rice and chilli garlic noodles. The noodles were quite tasty and clearly my best dish at the meal there. For a vegetarian meal without drinks we paid about ₹1000 per head. I recommend opting for the buffet option here which will give you greater variety.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or310-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

50,5-Jun-15,Guilin in mainland Chima,"A couple of years ago I made a trip to Guilin and was very impressed. I expected everyone to to dressed in Mao Tse Tung clothes but instead, walking around town you could have imagined w alking around a North American city. I can't remember the name of the hotel but it was very western like and very cheap --about 25.00 US/ night. I also took a boat up the Li Jiang river and that was very interesting. The scenery was much like Halong bay in Vietnam or Krabi in Thailand. Tetons rising all along the river. We returned to Guilin via the tour bost about halfway where we stopped a little souvenir town. I couldn't eat the food that came with lunch on the boat so I went into a little restsurant/bar type place hoping to get a sandwich and a coffee. A lady brought me the menu and the first three items were : dog-all kinds, snake all kinds, spicy pork penis. I closed the menu and just ordered a coffee.The little village was nest to walk around and then a bus took us from here to Guilin. I was very glad and super elated to find a McDonalds in Guilin and I was able to pretty much get around the food situation. I highly recommend a trip to Guilin. I got there by Dragonair out of Hong Kong. In hong Kong I was able to get a mainland and this was done for me by a travel agent in the hotel I was staying in (Hong Kong).",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or320-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

50,13-May-15,Lip Smacking Oriental Food with great service,My family's first choice for Chinese food in Mumbai is Mainland China at Andheri West.

40,12-May-15,Lip Smacking Oriental Cuisine,"Mainland China has established itself as a reliable brand for foodies who wish to enjoy Chinese and other South Asian fare at a mid-range pricing. Ofcourse the oriental fare is sufficiently 'Indianized' to suit evryone's palate.Their outlet at Vashi will fulfill your expectations on most counts. The minimalist décor without making the eatery a museum for Chinese artifacts is what sets it apart from other so called Chinese restaurants in Navi Mumbai. Anticipate a soothing ambiance. Serving staff is polite and knowledgeable.The lunch buffet is reasonably priced and provides sufficient variety from appetizers to desserts. The a-la-carte menu also provides an eclectic variety of Chinese and Thai cuisine. I’d recommend the lemon grass grilled chicken, pad thai noodles, pan fried chilli fish, their dim sums especially the sui mai prawn, stir fried chicken with chillies garlic and hot basil and their dim sum brunch buffet. For desserts, stick to the honey noodles in icecream.Overall a great place to enjoy a relaxed meal with family and friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or350-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
40,11-May-15,"China the ""Indian way""","Entrance not really spectacular, going through a plain lobby and business elevator. Dining area is ok.We don't start well as they don't have even Chinese beer: Indian, Mexican, Dutch, others but no Tsingtao?! Good comes and on the table you find fork and spoon to eat. No chopsticks and not even the typical Chinese spoons. Not a good start.But then the starters came. The prawns were spectacular, non anywhere close to how you would eat them in China, but good. Tried to test them on Sichuan dishes. Spicy yes, but just in the form of more pepper, but not the typical Sichuan spices and flavors. Still very good. Conclusion: recommend to enjoy something ""good and different in India"" but not for ""I want the real Chinese food""",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or350-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Although it's location is not great, being right on the MV road and at the Saki Naka jn- definitely the most crowded place of Mumbai- it is worth taking the pain to visit this place on special occasions. The prawns fried rice is one item, which i would always order here.

40,19-Apr-15,Great Chinese food,This place checks almost all boxes of a fine dining Chinese restaurant. The only disadvantage is the location as it is right at a very busy junction. They have valet parking which is a boon given the location. Once you enter you are transformed to a different place. They have spacious tables with circular seating for large groups. Sea food is their strength and would suggest to try all their preparations. Staff is prompt and responsive and the food is awesome. Wish all other Mainland China restaurants were in the same league.

Staff was courteous and helpful. Weordered just two Sweet Corn soups into half making it for four;, one Hakka Noodle, two plates of Fried Rice and two Hot & Sour Veg. accompanied by freebies like Sousages and mouth watering Salads That not only satisfied our full hunger but left a lingering aromatic air in the mouth after we finished.My guests from Jaipur remarked ""Indeed!

Air conditioning is also common to the mall which is not so effective.They landed up swiping my card twice and didn't inform me.

However they were gracious enough to apologise and are always quick to volunteer a complimentary dessert which is a nice touch .Recommendations - them sweet and chilli prawns , steamed fish ( you can choose from pomfret, bekti or basa) in delicate sauces and the clay pot rice. Dessert try the chocolate rolls with ice cream. Sinful but delicious ....

I only have one disappointment, dont know why but they dont have schezwan recipes on their menu n they dont keep schezwan sauce as well. When I asked for it they gave me some sauce that is similar to it..but it added to my disappointment.Their staff is mostly Chinese or from north east states.

And after visiting the powai branch , she realizes that ordering a la carte is way better than going for a buffet.A lovely sea food broth got us going. Four prawn dumplings later , she dug into some excellent hakka noodles. The general han's chicken curry was an excellent accompaniment.One trend we do notice is that in their buffets , food gets quite oily and salty. Even the sauces taste similar and insipid.But ordering fresh off the stove is really the thing to do. Prices are reasonable when compared to portions and ambience.

It is located on the top floor of the Palladium Mall. A small but decently appointed place, it lacks rest rooms, and their manager would point you to the mall's washrooms which are conveniently located a little way off.The guys who took our order, filled them and came back to check on us were amazing. The trio consisted of one Nepali, one UP-guy and one chap from one of the eastern states. They were literally hovering over us, yet unintrusively, explaining the dishes, asking about how spicy we wanted them to be, offering suggestions, etc.We started with a Miso Chicken soup, then followed up with a pair of starters, one veg (Tofu) and one non-veg (Chicken). The main course consisted of Fresh betki fish with steamed rice. In the end, we ordered a coconut caramel custard for dessert.

Simple, the expert service, lovely higiene (bathrooms as well) and nice atmosphere. I just liked to be there. Although I wasn't happy about the taste so much I just enjoyed being there. If the chef is able to tone down a little on the fierce dishes and get the food right, it would be a five star place. Every bite felt very strong and thus I couldn't eat so much. Perhaps it's just how Chinese food is, if so it may tantalise your taste buds.

I have a lots of fond memories to the accompaniment of great meals. Now that this is Christmas time, I remember one year, when teenage carol singers circulated from table to table, spreading cheer, smiles and joy. :-) I order almost by rote these days: Peppery lemon soup, crackling spinach, steamed wantons, stir fry vegetables, chicken (pick any preparation), fried rice (pick any flavor) and date pancake with ice cream. Dependable food and great service - they behave as neighborhood restaurants should: remember you to the extent of where you sat last visit. :-) May the restaurant live long.

40,25-Nov-14,Great place for groups,"We don't usually go to Chinese restaurants as my family is not a big fan of the cuisine. However, it was a surprise lunch get together planned by my wife on my Birthday, where a close friend and family were invited to Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai.The fact that we went there more for the get together rather than the food, help keep expectations low. In any case, we have been to other outlets of Mainland China, hence the novelty factor was not there.We got a good table for all of us and then the excellent service took over. Soups and a variety of starters kept coming to the table. For once, I did not miss being a non vegetarian as they had different kinds of veg starters as well.The buffet spread was equally good, though lesser dishes for vegetarians. We rounded up with the signature dessert of Honey glazed flat noodles.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or440-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
30,20-Nov-14,Chindian buffet,"I'm a purist when it comes to Chinese food but accept that most Indians prefer their food spiced. By now I've been to Mainland China, the Bandra as well as the Versova/ Andheri West branch, several times, It's usually when i was invited for a get together and it's nearly always the lunch buffet. For myself I'd prefer a more authentic place. The positives , if you like that sort of thing, are that the starters are seemingly endless and served at the table constantly. The waiters are very helpful and attentive , even with difficult guests and badly behaved children. There is a great volume of food..once you're through with starters, you have very little room for anything else. So if you are a huge eater, that is good value. The not-so-positives are that the food is smothered in spicy gravies and sauces, lots of oil, what the Bombayite would call ""chatpata"" flavours. The place is full, even on the weekdays we 've been and everybody generally likes it. Unfortunately I don't. There is not a single thing on the buffet that I would choose to order a la carte, and nothing is memorable or worth returning for. Lots of food, lots of spice. Maybe I would be better off ordering from the menu but since I'm generally stuck with a group and the buffet, that has not happened. For true Chinese I'd prefer Hai Bao, Lings, Royal China, so its not likely that I'd risk going here even for a la carte",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or440-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

I liked the noodles and the dumplings were something like never had before , so authentic. For dessert we had sizzling brownies. We had come to celebrate an occasion and when we told the staff about it they gave us another complementary brownie which was a pleasant surprise as three men brought it with a candle on it and one with a guitar playing it and one singing!

Lamb, Chicken, Tofu... Hot & sour soup etc etc... and the tea.. we were delighted when the visitors said all these are 100% authentic food and would match any restaurant in Singapore or Shangai as original !!! They felt probably the Chef is from China... they confirmed the interior carried original Chinese alphabets (not the simplified one) and declared this is authentic and commented this is a very good job.. unlike America where you get food that has no connection with original.Good Job to Management of MLC for ensuring authenticity.

I have had food at 5 different MC restaurants across the city, but no one is upto the level of the Sakinaka outlet. (The pic here is that of the Vashi outlet).The food is very good. There can be arguments about its standing in comparison to other high end outlets, but for the money, you can't get better. I've had a-la-carte, lunch buffet's and set menu items, and unlike other places which short-change you in buffets and set menus, they don't. And the service is impeccable. One time, our order got mixed up with someone else's. After being brought to their notice, our dishes were replace free of cost along with sincere apologies.

40,30-Sep-14,ALWAYS SATIATED,Mainland China is one restaurant where you will never go wrong. Their food quality is top most and of consistent taste. They use the best of the herbs and the preparation of all dishes is awesome. Many of their dishes you will never find in the run of the mill chinese restaurants.I like their unfixed menu concept where they serve the buffet at your table- from a wide variety to choose from. Also their unlimited buffet too is good with the fish taking the pride of place. The expensive spread with dessert is less than US$ 10 !!To top it the decor and ambience is upscale thereby providing the entire experience as top value for money.And if you celebrating a birthday- the staff will happily send a complimentary cake and put on the birthday song too.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or490-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
50,30-Sep-14,Fine Dining in Fine China,"MC Andheri is one of my favourite places to eat. The ambiance is great - from China silk curtains to fine latticework in wood- overall a nice classy touch. Their Service is very cordial - they always smile and accommodate you try and fit you in a spot of your choice. But the best thing about MC is their food! They are absolutely standardised, yet fresh in their condiments, in the taste, in the texture and tone. The food is never too salty or too spicy or too anything and it is a pleasure to tuck in. I suggest you go just a quarter hour before the crowd comes in ( and it does!) - around 1230 for Lunch and 745 for Dinner. Also ask them for any off the menu dishes thay they may have introduced but not put on menu. I found some lovely one ( potato cubes for e.g.) like that.

30,5-Aug-14,Mainland China - Lost Charm,"Have been to the Sakinaka junction joint number of times over the years. The food what they served earlier was simply great but not anymore. The portion has decreased, the taste is not what was. The buffet is also not too great except for the starters. Only good thing is their service which is still good. The staff never fails to impress me with their charm especially when it is someone's birthday and they give a complimentary birthday cake, sing the birthday song and moreover give their lucky birthday gift. Unfortunately, that is the only thing that impresses me now.

The Devil's lamb is to die for if you love spicy food.However, over the years it seems to have lost its charm. The portions have massively shrunk while the prices have gone up tremendously. Moreover, the menu is still the same over the last decade. They really need to improvise on their menu especially the desserts.

It was for about 800-900 rupees per person.They offered many starters; the noodles the vegetables the rice and every other dish was very well prepared. Just rightly done so to say.We had a guest from the USA and she was so enamoured with the delectable food there, that she said that she will tell anyone visiting Mumbai, India that they must have a meal at the Mainland.I think that goes to say that I need not write a single word more!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or510-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
30,1-Jul-14,"Mainland China - Sobo Central Mall, Tardeo, Mumbai - firrst run down experience","The name Mainland China always rings a bell for great food, value for money, authentic Chinese cuisine and this has been the normal experience whether it is the SAKI NAKA outlet or SUBURBIA Mall at BANDRA or even for that matter the SOBO Central Mall. Whether it is a business luncheon or a family dinner - the experience has more or less been the same. So you do crave to go here for Chinese food.However the recent visit was a run down experience - no complaints on the ambience and the service - it was the taste of food and the dressing that put us off and this was true for all the dishes ordered except the desert (honey noodles and vanilla ice cream). The chicken fat had not been appropriately cooked and the chicken meat was also not well cooked which spoilt the taste of the food.Hope not to have such a repeat performance at any Mainland China restaurant.RegardsKhozema Anajwalla",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or510-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
10,29-Jun-14,Mainland china - Viviana mall - simply Terrible,"Visited Mainland China, Viviana Mall, Thane for dinner alongwith familyFrom the beginning to end it was a terrible experience.The guy who took our orders , he was outright rude and couldnt even give an idea of thedishes what we were ordering. He was confusing us more. I had ordered for mineral water and for 10 minutes the water was not even brought even after repeated reminders. The soup was ugggh , too salty and hardly any chicken ...The starters were squishy and not upto the mark.To top it all they charge VAT at rates higher than what is stated in the act and the manager Mr. Abhishek was the rudest person I have ever metThe service needs to improve drastically. Very very very slow.Will never go back to the viviana mall outlet.would recommend others to take a call on thatthe management needs to review the running of this restaurant",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or510-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Very slow.Ordered drinks ( not in the buffet ). Four different waiters came with different take- coke available, not available, pepsi hai, only fanta etc. Finally the drinks came halfway through the meal.The dessert section has 3 ice creams, assorted pastries , cut fruits.

Average crispies, lower than average Thai spring rolls, a coffee lime sorbet that tasted suspiciously like the ubiquitous jasmine tea and hard brownies.

40,8-May-14,Great Ambience & Service,We went to Mainland China to celebrate my dad's birthday & wow did we have a gala of a time. We didn't go for the set menu & took the suggestions given by the restaurant.The ambience of this outlet is really good. It has a lot of open spaces that are well lit & still provide enough privacy for the guests. I really liked the decor.The food was really yum but did have its downs. We order 2 starters & 2 main courses along with a soup. The soup - seven sea soup which is a seafood soup was yum but had almost no seafood. The restaurant however did provide some crab meat but it was after they served the starters and the soup was cold.The starters a fried shrimp & a pan fried basa fish were delicious but the fish was a little too oily for our taste.For the main course we order burnt garlic fried rice & pan fried noodles. Again these dishes were spot on in flavor & presentation.Overall it was a good experience at Mainland & I would definitely like to visit.

50,14-Apr-14,Can't fault Mainland China,I have been eating at this location since it opened almost 20 years ago. The food still tastes the same which is fantastic. The a la carte is always better than the buffet but that you can say about most Asian buffets because the corn flour in the food makes the food lose its appeal after it sits on the counter for a while. The service has always been best in class. Crackling spinach is an all time favourite. It's one of the first Mainland Chinas and worth a definite visit if you're in the vicinity. Disclaimer: Don't be put off by the location. Its proved lucky for them and the proof lies in the fact that this branch is still doing roaring business.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or540-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

A bit of fried fermented tofu would have taken the dish to another level.Will definitely order next time with request to up the curry powder and add tofu.Food quantity was more than adequate for a couple and was neatly packed in heat sealed transparent plastic trays.

40,3-Apr-14,Good Buffet Option,Have been to Mainland China many times & its always better to opt for buffet option.Variety available for Buffet is pretty good & well spread.Taste is really authentic chinese.Though one place where they could improve upon is the speed of service.Even though when we visited the restaurant there were hardly many guests they took a lot of time in serving starters. Had to wait a lot for getting a repeat of the starters specially if you need dimsums. thus general advise is to take more rather than to wait :) I know it sounds cheap but thats what can be done if you dont like waiting for your food.The chocolate syrup fountain is really cool to use.Overall very satisfied & will keep visiting eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or550-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

My wife and son both love Chinese food and I love trying different cuisines, so this made a perfect setting during our first trip last November. They serve the most delicious and best Chinese food in town (atleast as we Indians like to eat it.....wouldn't know about authenticity and don' care either). Their soups, starters, main course...everything is excellent. They have choice of servings, which ensures that we don't order more than required. The staff is helpful in suggesting the dishes as well as portions depending on our requirements and service is fairly quick once you get a seat. Its a bit noisy during weekends but comfortable. The prices are on a higher side but worth every Rupee that we spent there.

50,4-Mar-14,Best Chinese Food ever,This restaurant is really a gem. Food is incredibly good. The ambiance is nothing special but clean and organized. Service isnexcellent. Was there with my son who is vegetarian. It was very easy for him to find excellent veg alternatives to the non-veg dishes that I have chosen. Best dish roasted lamb. Also a wonderful dessert (kind of sweet dumplings filled with coconut and honey). More expensive than average Indian restaurants (80 dollars for 2 people without wine) but good value for price.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or580-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

50,12-Jan-14,Best Chinese Ever,"The Hospitality and the Heavenly food makes it difficult for you to keep away from this place for long.AMBIENCE - 4/5The setting is very Oriental and spacious, leaving good space for patrons to move about without disturbing others. The lighting is soft and just correct. If you are celebrating a Birthday, the staff pops out a Guitar and strums up a few notes on it; a nice way to make you feel special.SERVICE - 5/5Just one word; IMPECCABLEI don't think I can find a fault with their service. Welcome Drinks offered on arrival. We were ushered to our table without a delay. Napkins from the table were unfolded and laid on our lap. Plates were laid and the starters started flowing; I am using the word ""flowing"" coz they literally flowed without a break. We had to tell the stewards to stop till we finished. Half eaten plates were promptly replaced and sauces replenished. The Stewards also insisted that we try some of their speciality dishes.Could we ask for a better service? A Special Thanks to Bryan for making our every visit special.FOOD - 4.5/5All I can say is that the FOOD IS DIVINE. There isn't a single dish on the menu which disappoints. I have been here for the Sunday Lunch Buffet and actually kept myself hungry since morning to enjoy the entire spread. The food flows in your plate from the moment you sit and till the time you say STOP, it keeps flowing.MUST HAVE's:1. Crackling Spinach2. Chicken Taipei - The best Chicken preparation in Chinese I have had so far.3. Dimsums - Couldn't be better.4. Fish in Mango & Mustard Sauce - Can you imagine Mango being used in a Fish preparation. You have to eat it to believe it. WOW!5. Chilli Garlic Noodles6. Fish in Chilli & Plum Sauce7. Caramel Custard - Another Beauty. The only other place where you get such a lip-smacking Caramel Custard is in some old Irani Restaurant in SoBo.8. Darsaan with Chocolate Fondue.PRICE - 4.5/5Worth every penny you spend. Some may call it expensive but Quality comes at a Price.I sum up my experience with 2 words, EXQUISITE and BLISSFUL.

40,25-Dec-13,"Mainland China - Kandivali E,Mumbai","Having visited their outlets across Andheri, Powai & Kandivali(E) in Mumbai several times & dined A-la-carte as well as Buffet options, here's my review based on my latest visit which is TODAY at the Kandivli E outlet & our choice was the Veg-Buffet. Since it was a holiday, as expected the place was packed, while we had done a prior booking, on arrival we were told the booking is not in place (!!!)...anyway all's well that end's well. In a few mins we got a nice table & as expected the food was good. Dim-sums are as always the best & as a vegetarian we may find few choices in the main course, the freshly sautéed exotic vegetables in a mild sauce were a nice change, paired with Celery & Lettuce Fried rice. Desserts - kids find the chocolate fountain so enticing & the usual staples like ice-creams, mousse, tiramisu, honey noodles, brownie and fresh fruits for the health conscious. So my verdict for the day : FOOD - nice, AMBIENCE - nice...particularly on a day like this it's a test in patience for all staff, so i'ts great that we could dine peacefully without any unwanted attention, SERVICE - good, but for the confusion in booking i would have said excellent. So when you want to have good Chinese meal, with mulitple options, just head to the nearest Mainland China & don't forget to take a mouthful of candied ginger while stepping out to digest all the food.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or610-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

50,14-Oct-13,Go nowhere else for Chinese!,"Mainland China's my only choice in Mumbai for Chinese food. From what I've heard it's more North East Indian Chinese than authentic Chinese (having never been to any part of China - mainland or otherwise, I have no way of authenticating this) but irrespective of the origin, the food tastes really good. I've lost times of the number of times I've been but every time, the crackling spinach, the dimsum, the green chutney accompaniment, the crispy chicken, the lamb, the seafood - every single time, all the dishes never fail to impress.Of all three outlets I've been, the Saki Naka one reigns supreme inspite of the location and lack of parking. Their set lunch weekday menu is ridiculously low priced for the quality and if you're celebrating a b'day or anniversary, just let them know and they'll make a nice fuss of the b'day person with a cake, candle, song, etc.Mainland China's the only Chinese place where I look forward to dessert - their honey noodles and their chocolate rolls are excellent.Oh and make sure you reserve a table on weekends - or be prepared to wait for a really, really long while!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or630-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
50,5-Oct-13,Excellent Chinese food,"What's not to like about Mainland China?For years it has been serving excellent Chinese cuisine with excellent service at less than 5 star prices.Yes, these days prices have gone up but the food remains stellar.For starters I recommend the crackling spinach, the wok tossed potatoes and the crispy corn. The crackling spinach is a legendary preparation here and is beautifully spiced. Oh and it does really crackle. Love it.My favourite main course is the Tsing hoi style corn and potatoes. It is loaded with cashew-nuts and fiery red chillis and they somehow complement each other amazingly. This dish goes best with the hakka noodles.The sweet and sour veggies with crispy noodles is another notable preparation.Mainland China also offers an excellent variety of beverages. Good wine collection too.If you choose to eat dessert, I recommend the honey noodles with vanilla ice cream. Simple, but wonderful.My experience is that the service can have its ups and downs.Expect to spend about 800Rs per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or630-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
40,17-Sep-13,Good food at many outlets,"I've been to two Mainland China restaurants so far. They have quite a few outlets in Bombay and in other cities in India.When eating at Chinese restaurants in India, I find they fall into three categories. The top, upscale Chinese restaurants often very good at a price, the mid range restaurants, often with local influence in the food, and then the bottom rung Indianised Chinese restaurants, stalls and eateries.Of the mid range Chinese restaurants, Mainland China is among the better ones.The food is relatively authentic though some of their dishes have been altered to local taste.Service is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or630-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
40,15-Sep-13,Chinese food ....best and consistent throughout,"I must have visited mainland china maybe over 50 times. Very frequent visitor at their powai restaurant. Located on the first floor in hiranandani gardens, the interiors are well done but the restaurant becomes a bit noisy when full. It is generally full all the time. The seating capacity is huge . They have a separate dining space that can be booked for 14-16 people.The food has been consistent throughout ..had been to their saki Naka, bandra and powai outlets quite often. However their menu in Delhi restaurants is quite different.The dim sums are a must try. One dish of the menu is chicken supreme ( comes with celery and pepper). They are very courteous enough to make for us every time we go.The seafood menu is excellent. Try the crabmeat and the lamb starters also.The prices are reasonable and in some items offer different size portions( regular and large)Powai branch also offers the weekdays buffet which is reasonable. But if you want to experience the weekend buffet go their and hero west lokhandwala branch. It offers the best spread.I would recommend all Chinese lovers for mainland china. For regular visitors , the membership card is handy and you can redeem points .Must try.reservations recommended during weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or630-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
50,14-Sep-13,"Delicious, Economic Chinese food","I have lost the count of my visits to Mainland China. I love this place & especially lunch buffet. As one of its outlets is close to my work place it has been our first choice for celebrating any occasion. Some of the USPs of mainland china:•Lunch Buffet costs only appx 300 to 400 rs pp. Weekends are little over this price range.•Reasonably good spread of buffet.•Nice ambiance•Prompt service•Yummy Chinese food & not Indian Chinese food.I love soups, dim sums & Chinese tea which they serve. Starters come in good variety & are served at table. Main course is very limited. Normally its one rice , one noodle dish & veg /non veg gravy however once you are full with starters you won’t need it much. In deserts there are 3 flavours of ice creams, chocolate fountain, some assorted pastries. Overall its delicious & economic buffet.Al a carte menu is fabulous though its little expensive. There you get good variety as compared to buffet.Some points to consider:1.in my knowledge there is no dinner buffet. Buffet option is only for lunch.2.no corporate discount on buffet.3.if you are a frequent visitor like me to mainland china then you might find the lunch buffet boring after some visits as the menu is almost the same every day which minor changes.4.during lunch time almost on all the days ( at least kndivali outlet) this place is crowded. hence on a safe side book your table if you are going in a big group.To summarise I recommend this place to all. Especially try out lunch buffet once.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or630-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

The smiling attendant seated us to our table, and quickly handed us the iPad menu. Impressive !The setting is very Oriental and spacious, leaving good space for patrons to move about without disturbing others. The lighting is soft and just correct.SERVICE - 5/5Just one word; IMPECCABLEI don't think I can find a fault with their service. Welcome Drinks offered on arrival. We were ushered to our table without a delay. Napkins from the table were unfolded and laid on our lap. Plates were laid and the starters started flowing; I am using the word ""flowing"" coz they literally flowed without a break. We had to tell the stewards to stop till we finished. Half eaten plates were promptly replaced and sauces replenished. The Stewards also insisted that we try some of their speciality dishes.FOOD - 5/5All I can say is that the FOOD IS DIVINE. There isn't a single dish on the menu which disappoints. I have been here for the Sunday Lunch Buffet and actually kept myself hungry since morning to enjoy the entire spread. The food flows in your plate from the moment you sit and till the time you say STOP, it keeps flowing.On the whole, a nice sophisticated place serving good food, a warm and lovely ambiance.I am definitely visiting again :)",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or630-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

40,26-Aug-13,Good Chinese at good rates,"Mainland China is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Mumbai. It claims to be authentic Chinese and Cantonese fare however, many of the dishes are adapted and spiced up to suit the Indian palate. Mainland China has multiple outlets across Mumbai - the best ones being Bandra West, Powai and Andheri East. The ambiance, friendly service, good food and good pricing all gets a thumbs up. Be warned though on weekends, the restaurant can get very noisy especially when certain outlets (like the Bandra one) host the weekend buffet. If you can live with that, you're in for a good meal. My regular favourites on the menu include - the Eight Treasure Soup, vegetarian Lettuce Wraps, Corn and Waterchestnut Dimsum, Golden Garlic Rice and General Tao's Chicken.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or640-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

40,20-Aug-13,Gourmands who love 'Indian Chinese' will feel at home here,"Mainland China is one of those restaurant chains that have done well by catering to the public's taste for 'Indian Chinese' - mainly chicken dishes that are mildly spicy, with generous helpings of butter garlic sauces.Went here with friends who are regulars on a weekday. The lunch buffet costs Rs 700 bucks per head and if one shamelessly gorges on starters and desserts, it is extremely 'paisa wasool'. They make some delicious boneless chicken in different sauces and the waiters unobtrusively refill your plates. The fish and prawns in different Chinese sauces turn out to be quite decent.I usually judge a place by the quality of fish they serve and both the prawns and fish (presumably Basa) were quite fresh. For obvious reasons of economy, the fish and prawns in the starters make a late entry when patrons would have stuffed themselves with chicken and vegetables. But since all three of us who went for lunch were pretty hungry, we pestered the waiters to repeat the prawns and fish several times.The vegetarian starters we nibbled at for sample sake were pretty okay, but no match for the prawn/fish items.The buffet table also had more chicken and prawns items, but the dry crab in a white sauce turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately, we could find many crab bellies and we had to search hard for its meat.Desserts too had several varieties, but the miniature caramel pudding was classic. Served in a small matka, the puddings the size of carrom board coins were warm and delicious.All in all Mainland China is value for money. I am told that the quality of food at their outlet in Kandivli and elsewhere do not match what you get at Andheri. Haven't checked the other places personally, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or640-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Real good cuisine spread and real good taste.I was earlier sceptical to visit it, assuming that it'll be a pure authentic Chinese food, too bland for my Indianised taste buds, but olla !! i was not disssapointed at all ! They have adopted it quite well for the Indian tastes without losing the originality of the preparations!I've visited the outlets at Bandra (above Shoppers Stop) and in Malad (Infinity 2 Mall). Ambience is great however the Bandra one is much more spacious and laid back, The servers are quite helpful in selecting the menu, specify your choice to them and let them suggest their best offerings. I went with their suggestions and loved the choice that they made for us.At the both the occassions, we had a birthday celebration, and they arranged for a lovely Brownie Cake , with candles and the works and also served us a bottle of Sparling Wine , All this ON THE HOUSE !! Wow! Really nice of them! So would suggest that its an excellent place to go in for Celebrations, however book in advance and let them know about the occassion so that they can have things in placeDim Sums are a must have's here, and i was lucky to have visited the Bandra outlet, when they had a Dim Sum festival going on.Also loooved the chilly garlic noodles, its was fab and hot !

40,12-Jul-13,"Good ""Indian"" Style Chinese Food","First of all, the food at Mainland China tastes nothing like the Chinese food I am used to. It is very Indian in style, preparation and taste. That being said, the food is very good. The restaurant offers a variety of veg and non-veg dishes, and seems to specialise in banquets for large groups. The dim sum dumplings were reasonably authentic, the rest I would not have picked as Chinese had I not been in a restaurant called Mainland China. Appetizers were mainly fried - the best being the deep fried corn. We had so many appetizers served that I didn't get to the mains, but the rest of my group found them ""Unusual but tasty"".Mainland China is worth a visit if only to see how Indians interpret Chinese food.

50,2-Jun-13,Great atmosphere,"As our friends recommendation we visited Mainland China. The interior, atmosphere and music were really Chinese. Food was Indian-Chinese. But it still tasted beautiful. We ordered dumplings and lettuce wraps for entree. When it came to our table we decided to order only one main dish. Because lettuce wraps were huge. Dumplings was tender and yummy. My husband loved the sauce that comes with dumplings. He had that sauce with everything. Lettuce wraps were super yummy. It was perfect balancing of spiciness and sweetness. Even for me who is from Mongolia that doesn't eat spice at all, it was beautifully spiced. Then we had lamb for main. It was cooked the way I like which is you can see the real color of meat. Made me miss home, made me mind that wants to visit this place again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or660-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

50,3-May-13,Great Chinese food,"We had a guest from the US, visiting Mumbai and he happened to be a vegan. So after a lot of thinking over choices, we decided on Mainland China located in the SoBo Mall, near Haji Ali, Tardeo. As soon as we entered all of us were impressed with the spaciousness and the Decor. Truly spectacular. We were six of us and were allotted one of the finest tables in the restaurant. We started with the Lemon and coriander soup.....truly subtle and fired up our taste buds for further courses. The soup was followed by veg corn dim sums! Subtle again and left us asking for more. On to the main course, consisting of Lotus leaf wrapped almond rice (steamed), a delicate and tasty vegetarian dish with silken tofu......I mean it, the tofu was one of the best we ever had, and another spicy vegetarian dish. delectable, to say the least. Finally, we had to find out a suitable dessert for the vegan, remember? No problems, the waiter suggested the date 'ice cream'. Wow! delicious and guess what...subtle again!! To sum up, we all had a wonderful dinner experience and our vegan guest commented that it was the best Chinese meal he ever had in India!!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or670-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

40,17-Apr-13,China Man,"If you are an Indian and prefer a heavy blend of Indian version of Chinese cuisine then stay away from this place. It strives to serve good Chinese food perfectly adapted to Indian palate.After an hiatus of about 6-7 years I visited the Franchise opposite to Infinity 1 (Link Road, Oshiwara) with my family and we were not disappointed. The personalised service (thanks to Ashok) made me feel at home as soon as I was seated. Ashok also taught my son to use the chopsticks which made him feel good too.The menu card (tablet) was heavily filled with fish items with a few chicken and lamb dishes. But I guess, the chef wouldn't have minded if something was ordered out of your imagination. The service was quick (maybe because it was an odd weekday), yet I presume it wouldn't differ much on weekends. The chicken dumplings (Momo's) had one of the thinnest coat that I have eaten in some time. A simple dish like Fried Rice and Schezwan Rice too were well made.The ambience is perfect for a family outing though the tables appeared to be slightly cramped for more seating place, yet no complaints regarding it. All in all a good place for better Chinese menu..",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or680-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

The spread is obviously lesser than the ANDHERI one, but its value for money. The starters and soup is just amazing. Prawns are fantastic and are value for money. The waiter ""DEV"" served us so well, and took ample personal care of us wvwn though the restaurant was over crowded. I simply loved being pampered.

The crabmeat soup, garlic steamed prawns, stir-fried shrimp with sambol sauce and prawn fried rice are to die for. Slightly expensive but worth it.

Like usual they served Jasmine Tea while we waited for the main course. It was 8 of us and we had a normal veg. dinner (soup, starters, noodles, rice, dessert) and believe me, everything was amazing about the food. Infact the noodles is the thin variety and tastes much better than the thicker variety that you get at most places. However, to my shock, the bill came to around 5000!! Thats around 650 per person and that too for a very normal dinner.

The menu surprising did cater to a lot of their tastes and based on that alone, I would suggest that this venue offers more than just Indian Chinese food.The service was very attentive and for some odd reason we were offered a complimentary bottle of Indian sparkling wine at the end of the meal. I case you are wondering, we did take them up on their kind offer and the sparkling wine is more sweet on the palate than dry so fortuitously ended up being a nice way to finish a very good meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or690-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

A look at the buffet spread made me hungrier than I'd thought I was. Go for the lunch buffet, which includes one drink (which could even be a beer!) and unlimited everything else. They serve starters at your table, so request a selection and ask for repeats of the ones you like.Eating strategy: Bring back some of the main course to sample at your table even as the starters continue - helps you decide which items you like best and focus on those.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or710-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

40,15-Jan-13,Chinese buffet,"It was my friend's recommendation to have a Sunday brunch at Mainland China, at Andheri (West) in Mumbai. My friend told me to be on time, as the place gets crowded quickly around lunch time means by 1pm.The restaurant was easy to find, the valet parking (at owner's risk) was efficient.The place was not so crowded when we entered but within half an hour, it was almost full.The ambiance was nice and comfortable. We were welcomed and shown an appropriate seat. I was surprised to see that they offered buffet lunch. I have never seen a Chinese restaurant offering buffet. Normally, you are seated and order a la-crate.We were served a drink and starters on the table - they had several options in vegetarian and also non-veg. I would particularly recommend the vegetable dumplings and also spicy potato wedges.The main course was a choice of soup, a couple of rice varities, noodles, fried vegetables and so on. They served prawns, lobsters, lamb and chicken dishes as well. Of course, all adjusted to the Indian taste buds, therefore, very tasty!There was a wide variety of desserts - fruits, ice cream, souffle and so on.Overall, it was worth the time (and money) we spent, very relaxed and very nice lunch that was.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or710-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

My daughter is is still 5 years old n hardly ate anything was charged a child rate for the set meal which did not match the earlier policy. V spoke to the manager in charge who did not bother to hear us out. It was simply irritating to even speak n v finally decided to pay n leave.

30,17-Apr-12,I-Pad for Menus? Not sure about this one...,I must admit when I was handed the electronic menus it felt jarring against the backdrop of dated decor. They could have invested in sprucing up the dining area instead of gadgetry whose novelty wore off within minutes of checking out whether Google Maps worked or not. Lol.But the main purpose of visiting a quality restaurant is its food. I was pleased that all but one of our chosen order was delicious. Staff were friendly. The ambiance varies from the three segments of the building you're in. The waiting area near the entrance was okay as long as you're limited in number. Very impersonal once other guests join you.To the right is a narrow dining area which appeared cramped yet cosy at the same time. We requested to be seated in the main dining area by which was in full occupancy - definitely a good sign. Fine dining experience? Definitely not. You will not be disappointed if you're prepared for an average meal. Price compared to the UK makes it quite reasonable although I understand its not cheap generally at app £20 (UK pound sterling) per head.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or830-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Well, what can I say, being an NRI I had different expectations. Definitely did not want to eat the sort of Chinese food you get in USA. But that is what they offered. I guess it is matter of 'grass being greener on the other side of the fence'. When I go to India I want Indo-Chinese. This was not that!

30,15-Mar-12,"Average food, not VFM, can give it a pass","I was at the restaurant at Bandra for a lunch buffet last week. Both the veg & non-veg soups were quite ordinary (Sweet corn & lemon coriander). Starters included chicken, fish, cauli flowers & potato fingers. Nothing exceptional here as well. The only intersting dish in main course was the 'live' mix veggies. To top it up, a loud gang of ladies was playing housie in the restaurant! Overall at ~Rs700 bucks a person, the place is not worth the money.

40,5-Mar-12,Burns your pocket but leaves your tongue contended,I had been here last sunday without a table booking. Had to wait in the lobby for around 20-30 mins which was quite tolerable. But an hard to digest fact was that I was not served water even after multiple requests which is the least you could expect from a class restaurant like this.We started with the dimsum platter. It did not tickle my taste buds. We immediately went to the cantonese noodles which was wholesome for 3 of us. As usual I always prefer four treasure vegetables because of shetake mushrooms which I love beyond anything. We ended the dinner with a well deserved Hot chocolate brownie. The bill came to 1.7k which for a 3 course meal for 3 people with limited appetite.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or840-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

30,28-Feb-12,Localized decent Chinese food,"I used to frequently dine at Mainland China in Andheri East several years ago. I was happy when they opened a branch in Andheri West near my apartment few years ago. Actually I had opportunity to dine at Mainland China in New Delhi too.The problem with this chain is that the quality of food and taste varies greatly between any two restaurants.Anyways ambience in the Andheri West restaurant is very good. I would say that soups are ordinary, starters are good but the main course is not of desirable taste and quality. Since I travel extensive in Far East countries and get to eat nice Chinese food besides there are several other Chinese restaurants within the closeby hence food at Mainland China appears just normal localized Chinese food at quite expensive price and atmosphere is noisy during dinner time.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or840-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

After that we have a choice of rice or noodles with the meat of the duck, and we chose noodles. All to be washed down with Chinese tea, which is not my cup of tea.All in all, the taste and smell of food at Mainland China is unbeatable.

50,11-Feb-12,For A Great Dining Experience,"Mainland China has several restaurants at Mumbai and those include the old one at Saki Naka and the relatively newer one at Powai. Both of these restaurants deliver the same exquisite dining experience - though the one at Powai is at a location that is less noisy and easier to reach and find parking. Mainland China delivers a great dining experience every time a customer visits them. The interiors have been made with great attention to detail and make the restaurant seem to be in China, not India, with different objects evoking a Chinese atmosphere. The staff is courteous, friendly and efficient. The menu is well presented and the options of both food and drink are many, including for vegetarians. As the food seems made afresh, it takes time after being ordered but every dish is made to perfection and tastes great. Though there can be debates about how authentically Chinese a restaurant can be in India, it is quite clear that Mainland China has steered clear of Indo-Chinese cuisine and delivers a different Chinese cuisine in India. The prices are moderate compared to the ambience and the great food. For any dining occasion, Mainland China is a good option.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or850-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Nothing we have tried here has been anything less than mouth wateringly divine.Choices for vegetarians are also more than adequate, No MSG is a definite option, and the waiters are happy to assist to ensure you choose well from the vast menu.Prices are certainly not low, but you do get what you pay for in every respect.Mainland China has acquired institution status, especially in Bombay, thanks to its unfailingly high standards.We look forward to going there again .......",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or860-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

30,17-Jan-12,Hey guys - pull up your socks,"Our visit to the Mainland China outlet at Malad - West turned out to be a huge disappointment.We expecting the waiting period and got in after about 45 minutes. It took quite a while to get someone to look at us .... finally thecaptain arrived, proceeded to take our order. We started small talk amongst us waiting for the food to arrive ..... but it never did. Finally after 60 minutes, we realised ( the management admitted too ) , that they had misplaced the order. It was hard to say if we were more hungry or upset .... but sanity prevailed when we realised that jumping off at this stage will mean waiting again at some other place. So we played along ... they played catching up all the time .... and tried to deliver quickly , Needless to say the food was atrocious.Never again ... was the mantra for the eveningIt's time these guys stopped riding on their reputation and pulled up their socks big time !",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or880-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

50,9-Jan-12,"The best set menu, fantastic service, simply outstanding","My parents visit the Mainland China at Sobo Central often and my mom informed me of their set menu special in which they offered any choice of soup*, 2 veg & 2 non-veg* appetizers, 2 veg & 2 non-veg* main course dishes, 1 type of rice and 1 type of noodle along with 2 desserts. *no special dishes such as prawns, lobsters, crabs.The price was way below my expectations and hence I called to confirm the details. Amazingly, Raajith confirmed the same over email and I was more than happy to book a table for my 16 guests at their Sobo Central outlet.When we arrived, we were promptly seated and assigned around 3-4 stewards who would look after our needs. We were immediately served their day's special appetizer made of spinach complimentary. The children were kept busy with a complimentary brownie with ice-cream. Soon the soups arrived (each of your guest can suggest his own choice within the extensive menu, but obviously the more choices, the longer it takes to serve). As the soup bowls were cleared, they started serving our chosen appetizers. The spicy lamb was very tasty and so was the fish in lemon coriander sauce (not sure of the name of the dish). The vegetarian appetizers were equally tasty.Just having completed their round of appetizers my guests were surprised that there were yet another 4 main course dishes waiting to be served. Once again, each and every dish was outstanding including the fried rice which many restaurants get wrong. After all this food, finally came the desserts and even though everybody was stuffed to the extent of bursting, nobody could resist the honey noodles and chocolate balls with ice-cream.Lastly, as a good will gesture, Raajith even offered me a bottle of sparkling white wine in appreciation of our patronage.Anybody who is exploring hosting a dinner for their guests must surely consider Mainland China and reach out to Raajith and leave the rest in his and his team's hand to enjoy a wonderful evening.The only thing that I could've hoped for, but wasn't possible with the current interiors of the restaurant is a table that was set in more of a square shape than a long table, as the square would've allowed easier interaction amongst the 18 of us.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or880-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

40,2-Jan-12,Good food yes authentic chinese....NO,I have tried Mainland China many times in many places from Kolkata to Mumbai(Saki Naka and Vashi) and Pune the last time I tried it a few days back at Vashi food served at these outlets was generally good the Kolkata outlet is best if you love the original Chinese taste as available in HongKong or other S-E Asian countries Saki Naka and even Pune had some great noodles and other stuff slightly more geared towards an Indian( Marathi/Gujarati) audience but the flavors were quite good ... vashi outlet was a slight disappointment though the flavors were too Indian to really qualify as Chinese although o.k but I would like a bit more of authenticity surprisingly the service was best at Vashi ... in Pune we had to wait for an eternity for the simplest of orders; overall it continues to be one of the best chinese eatery in town although when it comes to pricing the prices are on the higher side for cities like Pune and Kolkata; come'on pass on the benefits of lower rents/overheads to your patrons in these smaller/cheaper cities; I would suggest differential pricing for these smaller cities so that more people can enjoy good chinese food,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or890-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
30,31-Dec-11,did not live up to the hype,"This place was recommended by my mom as being one of the best places...unfortunately (as some of the reviews below have mentioned) it's a bit of a hit or miss. Unfortunately it was the latter for us.We were a group of 8 adults for lunch. It was a la carte and to be honest the appetizers were fantastic, which might have raised our expectations for our main meals. The mains left much to be desired - from the general t'sao chicken to the various lamb dishes. Everything was either watery or extremely bland.In terms of the service - we had to ask three times for our soups, finally the manager came over and all he did was stare at us and then went away. Shortly after the soup did arrive (along with the main meals).For 7 mains and 5 appys the bill came up to 9000 rs/-.I do have to mention that the bathrooms are the cleanest public bathroom I've seen in India (outside of the major hotels). I had no qualms changing my newborn in their toilet on their change stations.Doubt we'd go back, even though it does come with rave reviews!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or890-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Not easy to rate them just as average.There have been a couple of times when the food is great and the service is up to the mark. Whatever you ask for is attended to and you think that it has the potential to be the ""best Indian-Chinese"" food.This generally happens during the lunch hours or when you are there for dinner.Rest of the times, the food is average and stale, you have to shout to get your waiter's attention, the service is shoddy and you just can't find the manager. I mean, how can a manager not be there to manage the place?You can always give it a try, but try whatever the waiter tells you is the speciality.

We had made a reservation for 8 persons and we were given a round table seating. Due to this the service to the extreme end guest could not be served and each time the guest was asked to pick his plate and get it close to the server.

50,3-May-11,Excellent weekday buffet !,"The weekday buffet at Mainland China blows you away with their unlimited starters, and the buffet spread itself.Its best to get there around noon, before the kitty party crowd hits. The ambience is very good. Darkish, but there is enough light, so you dont bump into anything. I was impressed with the quality of the items on the buffet and the freshness of the food.At other times, some dishes are unbeatable, and some leave much to be desired for.

50,26-Feb-11,A true Chinese Experience in Mumbai,"Normally you have Chinese food from a regular restaurant which claims to make authentic chinese food but after we visited Mainland China at SOBO Central in South Mumbai we got the actual taste of authentic chinese. We chose the buffet lunch for a specific reason so as to get a chance to taste different preparations of meat and fish. The flavous were so brillinat that it was difficult to decide which dish to have more or less. Both of us vere satisfied for the fullest with our taste buds tingling to the variety of flavours offerred.In addition to the meals, the starters made a killing impression and we were almost on the verge of refusing to eat more. But we were glad to have continued. Icing on the cake was the variety of sweets/pastries and fruits on offer for the dessert.Overall a great experience and maybe like in the ad, would really would like to kiss the gentleman responsible for cooking such a great meal....joking..........",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or930-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

10,23-Dec-10,Disinterested management who couldnt care less about your experience,"Went there last night. First problem was wine by the glass was clearly old and we had to ask for a new bottle to be opened. Then the Peking Duck we ordered simply looked awful with a mud like brown concoction supposedly being the Hoisin sauce and dry pieces of duck with no meat on them. We explained that we know what Peking duck is all about having lived in Beijing for some time, and that we have had good Peking Duck in Mumbai, at Royal China and that the meal put before us simply did not look palatable and we were not going to accept it. This could have been sorted professionaly by the manager but instead he and a colleague kept insisting it was fine. We of course, asked for the bill (of previous drinks) and left. Not once did any of the numerous managers standing around the restaurant make any attempt to soothe our concern or make any attempt at all to look after us as customers. I will never go back to this restaurant again. There is no management understanding at all of what customer service is all about. My advice is stay well away.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or930-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

The food is not real royal chinese quality. However, its good. But as a foodie, I expect a lot more from Mainland China. Their prices are nothing less than a 5 star restaurant.

Less than 300 metres away, Royal China serves the most awesome dimsums. So poor marks for that.The claypot chicken rice was bland, lacking flavour, oily and with a few straggly pieces of boiled chicken. The roast lamb was better.

Each time I have visited, I have tried different dishes (mostly veg) and am yet to find one about which there is a fallacy.The ambience of the place is very well done. I would also ask future visitors to try their hands on eating with chopsticks. In case you have a problem, the staff would help you get trained for it. A failure even after that will find you a friendly waiter bringing kids' chopsticks (tied on the back for support)Prices are not exactly cheap, but not very pricey either. And once you visit, you would find the prices to be worth the experience.

50,9-Nov-08,Dr.Tastebuds Chinese prescription for you,"For all those of you, who would not mind spending some extra penny from your pocket to relish a delicacy with a Chinese feel, atleast try it once, Mainland China.Let me share my experience with Mainland China in Sakinaka, Mumbai that i visited.It was just opposite to my office building at logitech park, we always desired to visit it, then there came a golden opportunity, i and my four friends had got confirmed in the company and it was party time.We entered the restuarant which gave a totally different feel, from the dusty traffic roads at sakinaka junction. It was very relaxing,an ambience who roars and shouts all about 'AWESOME CHINESE'. Therestuarant serving boys , we saw them going around with Tea pots andserving many at the table during lunch which we indians dont do much,tea along with lunch. I was wondering at that, when my friend said that 'Its free' and the told me the scientific funda of 'Tea' aidingdigestion as chinese meal gets a little heavier on our stomach.We then ordered soups and starter, and the best part was about the starter, it was golden fried corn, it was too very delicious to be described in a review, i suggest you try it for yourself. We liked the starters so much that we actually wished, we could only eat straters, but it being peak lunch hours, and we couldnt bear our hunger, we ordered pot rice and curry which was also, very nice. Then even enjoyed one-one relishing cup of tea along wth our lunch. We really enjoyed this experience.On our way back to exit door, we all received sweet cookies and guess what we all got a hidden message, inspiring ones in each of our cookies, we read it and the cookie and left from there.Must Try Place",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or970-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

50,15-Mar-20,Mainland China New menu Launched,"Mainland China has been associated with our life since I don’t know when.. so when they asked me to be a part of their new new menu launch.. I couldn’t be happier.This new menu is combination of some of their classics and some of their new addition.1st of all the ambience was such amazing and they were playing very nice music.The moment I entered the restaurant I immediately felt home. The manager Om was very helpful throughout.We tried Lung fung soup with egg white and Dynamite wasabi prawns as starter. Both of them were mind blowing.. The soup was a clear soup and tasted so healthy. Om suggested a drink for summertime which called Mandarin Swirl drink .. it was such refreshing that is perfect for a summer time. After that I tried Pan fried Japanese mushroom and Chiken dumplings ..

40,5-Dec-18,Pre-Birthday Lunch,"The pre-birthday celebrations began with a relaxed weekday lunch with the in-laws at Mainland China. This was our first visit to the Kandivali outlet and it was a good one indeed.The best part about weekday lunches is, that you have the entire place for yourself. We were immediately shown to our table by our humble host, Shravan, who made sure that we had a quality time. The tab menus are bulky, uncomfortable, hence I generally prefer the traditional paper ones. However, the tabs in MC came with a finished picture of the dish, which was a thoughtful touch to the menu.The lunch started off well with a quick round of Thai Style Chicken Dumplings and Prawn Siu Mai w/ lemon grass. Both the appetizers came out steaming, with the respective protein succulent, and the entire mouthful juicy. A special mention to the subtle flavors of lemon grass that left a refreshing note. Based on the recommendation from our host, we opted for the large portions of Singapore Rice Noodles and Cantonese King Prawns Hubei style. I can safely proclaim that we had the best rice noodles. For those who prefer to have some bite in their noodles, you might not entirely enjoy the rice noodles, and you might want to stick with the regular version. The prawns themselves were king-sized, but the gravy felt a bit flat in with its taste. Probably we didn't choose the sauce properly.With the main courses out of the table, we did manage to squeeze a dessert, which was a theater in itself. The chocolate dome gave away, as soon as the warm sauce made contact with it. The best part about this dessert came in the form of caramel popcorn on the side. A spoonful of the snappy chocolate dome, ice-cream, warm sauce, and few kernels of popcorn made for an interesting bite.We were surprised with an Apple, Orange, and Mint drink by the staff, which was refreshing after an indulgent lunch. In the end, we settled a bill of Rs.1800/-, which included a Zomato Gold discount. A great place to enjoy some amazing Chinese without pinching the wallet.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4570289-Reviews-Mainland_china_growel_mall_kandivali_east_mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Kandivali, Mumbai

The lunch buffet is sumptuous and the staff is generally attentive and cordial. There is a never ending supply of piping hot starters which are fresh and yummy. For the first time at the buffet lunch we also got crab beside the regular fish and chicken. My only contention or disappointment was that the food trays were empty and the staff had to be told to refill it . They not only did so but served it in bowls on the table. There was no one to welcome or see off too --which are common courtesies seen there earlier. The management need to buck up because there are other competitors in Cantonese food now.

For mains, one can try the 'Veg Dumplings in Chilli Soya sauce' along with their Veg Fried rice/Veg Hakka Noodles. The restaurant offers decent choices in deserts as well and you should try their 'Chocolate Brownie'.A Tip - The restaurant offer ala carte as well as the buffet however my suggestion would be to go for ala carte as buffet is not very lavish and items don't get replenished in time which at times can put you off.

20,30-Jan-16,Disappointed,"Had heard so much about this place as a restaurant for authentic and quality Chinese food. We went there for a team lunch from office. What attracted us to this place was the cost of the buffet. Priced @Rs440 for Veg and Rs500 for Non veg, this stood out as a perfect place for a team lunch. It started off with amazing starters and a good service. But the main course disappointed big time. They had Veg noodles and Veg rice even for Non veg. The stir fry was below average, and had limited gravy options. Desserts were ok, nothing exciting. Had a lot of expectations from this place.

The one at Growel Mall is very tastefully decorated with a spaced out seating arrangement. Over the time the staff has become quite familiar and provide a personalized service. The buffet veg and non veg lunch menu are real value for money - around Rs 600 pp+tax. Moreover, if you pay by HSBC credit card, you get a Rs 500 dining voucher in any of their restaurants which makes you to come back next time and this goes on.

When we expressed our intent of ordering a combination of buffet and ala carte, the manager gave us a look which was like ""so you want just a few buffets so that all of you can eat...i know that trick"". When I insisted, I was told to wait and then very categorically informed by the manager that 'we should not be sharing buffets...they can find out!'.

10,12-May-19,A Chinese outing gone wrong,"Mainland China is known for its good buffets on weekdays, churning out same dishes and generally does a decent job. I visited the restaurant on a family occasion during the weekend. The choice was A-la-cart. After a shabby start to the meal, with dim sums coming late and served on a plate dripping with the oil of the previous dishes, the most disgusting main courses followed. The cottage cheese was greezy, too much of sweet vinegar perhaps and the prawn and chicken dishes were hard to palate. The saving grace was mixed fried rice which was average and palatable.Those who are used to good Chinese food, could better stay away from this culinary ordeal. This was an assault on our senses.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or10-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

Stewards just hanging around but no one to take the order. Had to call people for placing the order. Food served was atrocious and tasteless. Serving was by untrained people. On wanting to speak to the incharge, one Mr Biswajit came up and as usual the only thing he could say was ""sorry"". Typical reaction when I wanted to escalate the matter to Mr Chatterjee - buy the customer by offering free desserts.Absolutely avoid this place...",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or10-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

I guess they have a new chef and I think certain signature dishes should not be tampered with.Soup was a bit disappointing but the Captain saved the day by realizing the problem and quickly changing it. Fish in Dragon sauce was superb! Of the two noodle dishes, the burnt garlic variety lived up to expectation but the second one was far too bland. Guess we made the wrong choice there. Overall, quite satisfied.The place has comfortable, familiar decor for years but that familiarity may now be giving way to contempt. Some decor innovation needed.

Having being to their chains at other locations, while I visit India, I was glad the service was excellent. We had two vegans, and the manager did his best to made the food that would work for them. The food was sumptous, spicy and tasted very well. Maybe its because of Mumbai taxes, but the drinks were over priced for the quantity.

40,23-Aug-18,Most authentic Chinese restaurant,"We have been a regular at Mainland China since many years now. While many restaurant chains have come and gone, this one has weathered the times with aplomb. The food and service quality - two most important aspects of any restaurant, have remained great all through. The ambience, decorations and other paraphernalia come second and I have seen very many new eateries focussing more on these than the actual food. But the food at Mainland China remains uncompromised.As a regular connoisseur though, what bothers me is the menu price has been hiked quite a lot over the years. It has now become one of the most expensive Chinese restaurants in Navi Mumbai. A meal for two easily costs between 2500 to 3000. When Chinese food is generally associated with affordability and where there are several competitors offering them at 1/3rd the price, their pricing seems to be quite an anomaly.However, if you want to keep value concerns on the backburner and enjoy authentic Chinese cuisine, then there is none better than Mainland China.My all time favourites are crab soup, Zuchhini spring rolls, Drums of heaven, teriyaki chicken, pan fried Asian chilli fish and king prawn Hunan style.The only dish that has disappointed me, not once but twice, was the Vietnamese clear soup which was very, very salty for a clear soup.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or30-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

For entree, it sounds cliche and perhaps a waste but the potatoes (Sweet and spicy) are incredibly delicious. There are plenty other options for chicken lovers. The fragrant rice with mushrooms and the kung pao tofu (sweet and spicy) are my go to for main course, Actually everything is so good there. Some water chestnut preparation as well is heavenly.

50,10-Sep-17,Essential visit for authentic Chinese cuisine in a pleasant ambience,We visited Mainland China recently for a buffet lunch. The soup and starters were extremely alluring.

30,22-Jul-16,Could do better,As the name suggests it's a Chinese joint. The options thus are limited. The veg food was ok but took a lot of time to come to our table.

40,28-Jun-16,"Mouth watering , Authentic Chinese Cuisine",Mainland China happens to be a favorite joint of mine especially in Navi Mumbai . Where the plethora of options is lesser compared to Mumbai. The best part of Mainland China is that here it is an absolute value for money especially their Buffet courses.

Chicken in oyster sauce was a tad bland but ok. Lamb quantities served in the regular dishes was quite large.The service was polite and quick. They recommended a few combinations based on our preferences.Liked the mocktails... especially the pineapple ginger frappe.The ambience was not thankfully not noisy. The decor was good.However the air-conditioning was low and made it uncomfortable to sit in the corner table with steaming hot Chinese food.Celebrated a birthday in the family here recently. However they forgot to sing any birthday song or serve the customary brownie and hence the 3 stars.Overall slightly expensive, different but ok food",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or130-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

When we asked which place the waiting was for, we were clearly told that there was atleast 15-20 mins waiting for each of the 2 places. On repeated request to put us on a list which is moving faster, we were added to that of mainland China. After a wait of 5 minutes, we got in. Happy we were, because we didn't have had to wait much longer. But once we were in, we found that there were so many tables free. Still wondering why a false que was being created downstairs ?!The food, service n ambience was all great, once we were in. That has never been a doubt here.The starters were too many and too good.

40,26-Jan-16,"Good, but needs to do more as per Mainland China standards","As I have eaten at many of their restaurants including the one at Saki Naka, where I ate non-Indian Chinese food the best outside Tangda and Kamling at Churchgate, I have come to expect the same taste out of all of Mainland China's restaurants. Consistency, is after all, the crux of brand franchise which attracts customers.To be fair, it was not bad, just the fact that I have come to expect better of them. So, true to form I ordered the buffet which allows one to sample a large part of the menu. The starters were usual, but, here seemed to be tuned more to the Indian palate with a tilt on spices covering the flavour main item in the dish. The lollipop though popular in India, for me does not belong here. For one hand food does not belong in Chinese food and secondly, these were not as soft as they had ligaments in them which made them bad to chew. The rice and noodle had a little too much of salt. These two minor things made me miss the old Mainland China taste more. The crab, dish, again on account of the crabs being too small and thus messy made the experience a bit tiresome.Now, on the good side the soup, gravy dishes and starters apart from the above critique were good. The dessert selection was also good and the litchi margarita was especially great.Coming from me I would prefer them to stick to the taste they were known for because that is what made them and not catering to the general spicy Indian palate which I experienced in the Vashi outlet. Let's if things change :-) One more thing, as the place gets a good crowd it would be a good idea to call up and make reservation during peak lunch and dinner time.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or170-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

50,18-Jan-16,Exemplary culinary experience,"We started out from Andheri towards Lonavala with no expectations but to have a decent lunch when we reach Vashi and then continue our journey ahead.But we were in for an absolutely delightful culinary experience when we decided to have an impromptu buffet lunch at Mainland China Vashi. The different explosions of food on our taste buds can only be experienced as i fall short of words to describe this amazing experience. This restaurant gives the traditional combination of aloo bhindi a tasty transformation in the form of crispy potatoes and okra in chinese flavours (a must try). All kudos to the extremely courteous staff particularly Mr Abhay and Mr Sujit and of course the Chef who was very shy and slightly flustered in accepting our compliments. Definitely fits the tagline...IF ITS CHINESE, ITS MAINLAND CHINA.

40,27-Dec-15,Go to place for Chinese food,Mainland China is my place of choice when it comes to Chinese food. It provides a good speak for vegetarian and non-veg food with option of chicken and sea food in most of the dishes.I would recommend to go for ala carte instead of buffet (available only during lunch hours) as the options for buffet are very run off the mill.We had ordered eight treasure soup which was very sumptuous. Dimsums and dumplings goes along really well with the soup. Pan fried noodles are a must try in entire mainland menu.Ambience and decor is consistent across all mainland China across Mumbai.All in all a great place to satisfy your cravings for Chinese food.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or170-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

30,29-Nov-15,For a Quick meal,Eaten at many Mainland China Restaurants....this one at Palladium is busy and service very quick. So it is a good place to stop by for a quick meal while shopping.However the music can be made softer. Even on requesting it to be turned down it could not.

10,1-Sep-15,Definitely not Mainland Material,"I went to mainland china, Vashi branch with my wife and daughter. We love the food they serve. The staff were very courteous. For my child was given a high chair, very good quality. We ordered from the special chefs menu. The soup served was very salty, on pointing out the captain took it back, brought us new soup which was nice. He was apologetic about it.Starters were quite nice. They we ordered panfried noodles. While eating that there was a long strand of hair in the food stuck to a vegetable. I pointed it out to the manager again he was apologetic and took the dish back. He offered to bring me a replacement, at that stage I was in no mood of eating. The thought of quality of food being served was now under question. We were feeding my child as well from the same plate, that freaked us out more.The management offered to parcel me the same dish, I refused. The manger then came and said they will not charge me for the dish and please accept complimentary dessert.Well I appreciate the apologies and not charging for a dish WITH HAIR, serving me complimentary dessert - its still DOES NOT negate the fact that food from the chefs special menu is sent back to kitchen and a place with such a name in the culinary business has HAIR in the FOOD.We were thoroughly disappointed with this experience, this was specially not expected from MAINLAND CHINA , on my way out the manager said please come again I will serve you specially.To add this I hold a speciality preferred membership card - now I question it purpose",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or180-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

Service is very good and the staff are polite and attentive.The décor needs to be maintained though, the veneer is losing its shine and the Vashi Branch is losing its exotic Far East Charm.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or180-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai
40,21-Jul-15,New Bombay's second-best Chinese restaurant,"You do a meal at Mainland China, and you realise why Anjan Chatterjee is a genius. He's got his formula down pat. You also see a great example of Bengali Chinese in action. (Nothing wrong with Bengalis or Bengali Chinese -- more later. I am a Bengali, BTW.)Mainland China does not serve pork or beef/ buff -- their non-veg offerings focus on the politically correct chicken, fish and prawn. They serve good prawn and fish. Their vegetarian offerings are decent, but the focus is on non-veg. They will have chilly chicken (here called General Tso's Chicken, IIRC) and a variety of fried rice including the Singapore Fried Rice which I never saw in Singapore.This is Bengali Chinese. For an alternate view of Indian Chinese restaurants, try Chung Fah of Pune Camp, or Ling's Pavilion near Regal Cinema, or The Bamboo restaurant in the Park, Belapur.The first Mainland China (in Bombay at least) used to be at Saki Naka, in Bombay. When it opened, the menu was innovative and really class-leading. Their stir-fried French beans were to die for. Some of that innovative approach has now gone out of the mainstream chain which Mainland China has now become. It's an extremely popular chain, because they deliver what most Chinese-food lovers in India want. Excellent decor and ambience, a somewhat up-market ""khandaani"" feel (lots of polished dark wood, for instance), very good service, a decent bar menu (necessary for those business dinners with clients). Together with this, the food is very well made, and has mild flavours, something which puts it in the upper bracket of Chinese restaurants. Unusual to see congee rice in most Indian Chinese restaurants, but these guys do it well. I treat Mainland China as comfort food -- excellent pan fried noodles with prawn, some chicken side dishes, some stir-fried vegetables, and a drink. Great fun. Very dependable.And their buffets are very popular and excellent value for money. Like Anjan Chatterjee's other restaurant (Sigree), this too does a top-notch, cost-effective buffet when you want to treat office colleagues or business associates and want to offer them a good lunch without having to think too much about the food.The best Chinese restaurant in New Bombay a decade ago used to be Yu Fan. It's now long dead. Today, the best is Bamboo in The Park, Belapur, but it too is suffering from low turnouts due to its location. Mainland China effortlessly sits as number two, in my view.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or180-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

I have to give them points for experimenting and trying out new dishes, even though some of them don't quite work (e.g., a dish called Sabo Chicken (sp ?) was quite bland).

And , recently, I ate the lamb chops.....Just melted in the mouth... you have to eat it to believe it !Afternoons, the restaurant offers a buffet in addition to the a la carte service. The buffet is well spread and the variety of offers (both veg and non veg) are amazing. Really worth much more than the Rs. 500 odd you pay !",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or220-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai
40,24-Dec-14,A good glimpse of China,"Having been to China, I wouldn't say you would get exactly Chinese food, but what I would call as Indian version of Chinese food. But it's as close to authentic Chinese food you can get in India. A nice place to hangout with friends, or for office parties. A lot of variety, but a little on the expensive side.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or220-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

The dishes were all recommended by them and loved 2 of them and hated the 1 dish, it was a gravy item. The ambiance was great and mostly it was all empty in spite of weekend.

Since this place shares its area with Sigri Restaurant also you can find customers of both of these restaurants outside the building area when waiting. The ambience is good and the food is also nice.

50,7-Oct-14,A memorable experience,"This Chinese eatery, located near the Vashi railway station is an ideal place for having a cosy dinner/lunch.It provides a buffet lunch which is very reasonably priced when compared to the prices of various dishes.We enjoyed their Hunan Prawns which is prepared with medium sized prawns in sauce and right amount of crispness. The fresh fruit punches they served (i do not remember the names) was exotic. Vegetable in mahlak sauce was also tasty. Chicken fried rice was the only dish which can be rated as so-so.Our lunch ended up with a nice ice cream ,an another wonder. I am happy that even though they have several branches they have been able to maintain their quality. The prawn/ chicken dishes are priced on the higher side and a lunch for four can cost anywhere between 3.-4 K",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or230-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

We ordered 8 island soup, chicken satay, pan fried noodles, honey lemon chicken and garlic fried rice. Unfortunately the complementary kimchi in the beginning was the best part. The soup was worse than Maggi powdered soup. Tasteless. The satay was again flavorless. The pan fried noodles cold and stale tasting. The lemon chicken was as sweet as toffee. Overall I felt its totally overpriced and no authentic experience at all. The staff was in a hurry to serve us possibly pre prepared food.

All items are vegetarian1) Vegetable Coriander Siu Mai Dimsums - Lovely, Great stuff with the mustard and pepper sauce- Starter ( This writer with the help of google and wikipedia understands that this dimsum was introduced during Quing dynasty.Today it is considered as part of cantonese cuisine.It is a single filling dimsum, and in today's case it was finely chopped vegetables)2) Vegetable fried wontons - Too much oil and too little filling - disappointing - The shape was interesting - starter3) Lemon chilly potato - Average - starter ( There was no lemon flavour)4) Stir fried vegetables - Very good stuff - starter5) Vegetable hot and sour soup - some people may like it - Overall taste is bland6)Onion garlic fried rice - main course - very good . Great texture and well cooked7) Veg Hakka noodles - main course - good for noodle lovers - I was expecting a smoky flavour, but it was missing- unfortunately this writer is not a noodle lover8)Mixed vegetable szechuan(sichuan ) sauce - The souce originated from sichuan province in south western china. It has a bold and spicy flavour due to the use of garlic and chilly peppers. Wonderful taste and goes well with all vegetables.9)Haricot beans with dry red chillies and sesame - Surprisingly it was made out of a green bean with pod and not dried bean - Interesting dish, but tastes only above average10) Vegetable dumplings in soya garlic sauce - Lovely stuff - spicy and an Indian palate will love it11)Seasonal vegetable in ginger wine sauce - This preparation in white sauce in bland and creamy.some may like it12) Various deserts13 ) Copious supply of jasmine tea - Wonderful beverage , goes well with the mealOverall food quality great.

Maybe some would consider this not to be authentic Chinese and may say that it is Indianized Chinese food. Maybe, but if you are not bothered about tags and want to have excellent food in a very good ambiance, this is the place. And very good service too.They serve Jasmine green tea on the house right from the beginning - only problem is that it is always lukewarm - never hot.They have valet parking - that is a good thing, as it may be quite crowded during peak times. They accept reservations over phone. If you do not have a reservation, you may end up waiting for 1/2 to 1 hour or even more during peak times.I personally liked the Almond rice cooked and wrapped in lotus leaves",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or260-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

40,15-Jul-13,A Chinese retreat,"Visited this restaurant on consecutive weekends. We had the Non-veg buffet lunch both the times. The food is good, but not exceptional. I loved the starters here, especially the pepper chicken and the money bag they serve. Don't expect any surprises with the main menu. I felt it is quite average. The lack of variety in the buffet menu is something which saddened me. I couldn't find much changes in the menu during my visit here. But it is a great value for money buffet i feel. for 525 Rs, you can get good Chinese starters+avg main course+good deserts. The buffet sounds to be the most affordable option here as the other items in the menu are bit costly. There is a bar available which has a good selection of drinks as well.

The ambiance is good and is priced reasonably well for the food and service they offer..Great food, authentic flavors; servers who genuinely care - even took the time to patiently teach us how to properly use the chopsticks; soothing ambiance w/ good oriental instrumental music in the background; the only disappointing bit about the experience was the cocktails maybe, but you don't go to a Chinese restaurant for the cocktails, do you :)Its as their TV ad says, the best chinese ever ! ps: esp the dimsums",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or270-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

40,9-Apr-13,Great food at a decent price,"Been a fan of the Mainland China chain of restaurants, so when the new outlet opened in Navi Mumbai we went over to sample the experience. At the start they took some time to get their act together (mixed up dishes, delayed service etc), but a short while later things started looking good. Their dishes are excellent - with a good number of vegetarian options as well. The dimsums are a delight, the lemon coriander soup lightens you up in anticipation of the main course which has great options too. Also the buffet is definitely value for money. What's more, the kids will love the crispy chilly corn and other entrees that tickle the taste buds. It isn't the usual 'chinese' fare dished out at other places - all in all, a tasteful gastronomic journey..!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or280-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

20,16-Mar-13,What's wrong with this Mainland China!! Poor service,Extremely poor service. I won't say the food was bad rather it was good just by the time it came my hunger died its own death :( majority of staff working there need training not in serving dishes but looking after allotted tables. Service by the boys was so indifferent. Been to different outlets of Mainland China in several cities but this one at Vashi left a bad taste,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or280-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai
40,16-Feb-13,Indi-Chini Bhai Bhai!!,Nice assortment of chinese gourmet with lovely decor and setup. There is a change in the way the Executive Lunch is served and somehow the buffet does not seem to have the same taste as it used to be.

If you like sweet and spicy food you must try their ""Sweet and Spicy chicken"". Also the various dimsums! Never had better. The only slightly bad experience I had there was during Christmas when I went for the special menu they offered that day. However they had run out of Duck as early as 9pm in the night.

30,15-Oct-12,Pretty ordinary,"The mainland china a la carte menu was stiflingly expensive and the taste of the rice dishes were not eto my liking. They were too bland and one had to literally search for the chicken/or prawn in the rice. Dissapointing experience. Add to it the service tax/Vat/ and a Service charge ? They want you to pay 10% of the bill to bring the food on the table and give you a smile. I had decided not to go to the place when a friend of mine recommended the weekday lunch buffet. Now that was a good one. It was real value at Rs 450/- (no extra service charges!!). They were thoughtfull enough to put half charge on my son who is 11 years, withou even asking for it. It was a good gesture. Looks like they have changed for the better. I shall definitely recommend the lunch buffet. Not the a la carte with the 10%service charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or290-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai
20,17-Sep-12,"Poor food, indifferent sevice","Extremely average, by the chain's standards (which itself are falling - more on that later). This one is not particularly helped by poor service. The food itself was indifferent. Went late, after the office lunch crowds were leaving. This outlet, relatively new, has come up at a location where clearly it is hard to find good staff. The building and surrounding areas also look like they would remain under construction for a while.I am beginning to wonder if the Mainland China group is expanding a bit fast. Having eaten at various outlets in different cities over the years, I am beginning to find that the food is extremely inconsistent, from day to day (at the same outlet), and from city to city. In their aggressive move to expand, they seem to have sacrificed quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or290-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

50,10-Feb-20,Amazing Chinese Food,One of the best places for authentic chinese food in Pune. I am totally in love with the variety of chinese food that they offer. I tried :DIMSUMS :Japanese Panfried Mushroom Dimsums :Yummy panfried mushroom dumplings with truffle oil. The taste of the truffle oil enhanced the flavour of the dimsums. Highly recommendedJapanese Panfried Chicken & Mushroom Dimsums :These were also delicious like the veg ones but even better with the nicely minced chicken in them.STARTERS :Stir Fried Water Chestnut In Hunan Style :Water chestnut stir fried in tasty hunan sauce which was also having a crispy layer so it was so damn good.Matchstick Potato With Truffle Oil :Finely made small potato sticks with truffle oil which was very flavoursome.Five Spice Chicken :Sapid flavours of different and secret 5 spices with a hint of cinnamon. The chicken was also well cooked.Lemongrass Fish :Well steamed fish with an impactful yet delightful taste of lemongrass. Simply loved this.Malaysian Curried Prawns :Flat prawns with malaysian curry but dry so it was something different and yummy. Could be less salty.MAINCOURSE :Fortune Clay Pot Vegetables :Fresh veggies with water chestnuts made in a fortune sauce which is made in house. It is so good that you need to eat with an accompaniment.Stir Fried Haricot Beans With Chillies & Sesame :A simple yet saporous flavour of chillies and sesame seeds.Chicken With Celery & Wine :A white translucent wine sauce with celery that went well with it. The chicken was also made very nicely. ❤️Sichuan Steamed Fish With Fresh Coriander :A very appetizing gravy with the aromatic flavour of coriander. This was so delectable.Celery & Chinese Cabbage Fried Rice :This rice was very savory and delicious. It went complimented well with all the main course dishes.Singapore Style Fried Noodles With Scallions :This was having a very different and good taste.

Food quality is excellent and maintain the reputation of good preparation. However it was observed foods are more spicy this time - either we had visited during Chinese New Year Festival period or they have made changes intentionally to make it spicy to meet customer taste.There is no Valet parking but enough common parking space is available in basement area.

They told me they will deliver instead. Upon opening the delivered food we've noticed there's no chopsticks or even plastic spoon for the soup. They know I'm staying in the hotel so I don't have any access to any cutleries inside our room and they didn't even mentioned they don't provide them. I rang the manager and he told me they don't give any and when I said was he expecting me to eat the soup straight from the plastic container, he told me to request cutleries from the hotel instead.

10,7-Mar-17,Chewy wanna-be Chinese cuisine - bad!,"The worst thing a restaurant menu can turn into is neither this nor that - because that's when McD becomes a preferred choice. Look, if you aren't serving Chilli Paneer anymore because you've become 'shi-shi fancy-shmancy', then please get your paneer substitute, tofu, right! When deep fried tofu - they claimed it was stir fried - is chewy, it means it is stale and/or refried hard, it's an insult to Chinese cuisine. When the 'General's' chicken has more doughy chewy cornflour and unknown chicken parts - it's stops being a 'general's cuisine'...some nice Indian starter snacks but again not fresh - corn 'chaat', nice gujju touch, was also not made of crisp and juicy bits of corn, but instead chewy and retired yellow somethings...sorry MC, you need to rehaul everything and your chef in your kitchen - keep rest of your staff, it was the only saving grace of our meal yesterday afternoon. And by the way, it's not 'Dimsums', plural - it's 'Dimsum', singular.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or40-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune

10,15-Nov-14,Quality of food and service takes a beating,"Happened to be in Pune and decided to go for dinner to Mainland China. Ooops....big mistake!Chinese food in India is not known for it's hygiene and this restaurant exemplified it. They added to the notion that you can never be careful enough when going down the Chinese food route.For starters, the cutlery on the table had FOOD STAINS on it. Ugh! I called the manager and showed it to him and he nodded nonchalantly as if it were a daily occurrence. No sweat, pulled out a fresh (sic!) one and put it on my table.My son asked for a diet pepsi and the waiter brought him a Jack Daniels. Wow! Hearing aids needed here...After we ordered food, to my horror the water served me vegetables whilst resting the bottom of the plate on the rice that was already on my plate. God knows where they keep the serving dishes while waiting to pour the food on it for serving, so the underside of the serving dish was something i certainly did not want resting on my food.My appetite went for a six and my opinion of the place went to the pits. Being popular doesn't necessarily mean that the quality will be great. The excellence lies in the small things and obviously the emphasis on hygiene is not on top priority here.Highly avoidable!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or120-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune

20,26-Aug-13,"Pathetic service, Small portions, Expensive","This was not the first visit I had to Mainland China - ICC. However, this was the worst of all visits and needs a special mention here. While booking I was told that coming early would be better since tables are full post 2000hrs, however while we left at 2120, tables were still available.Drinks - We were told that wine by glass is not served at all and only by bottle would be available, which is such a big limitation on choice for the entire family who would want to have separate drinks.Soup - We ordered for soup and mix of non alcoholic drinks and breezer eventually and they were all good.The complimentary kimchi and cucumber salad was good and when we asked for a refill, for a long time nobody came and when they did they rudely put across a huge bowl of each, in front of us, as if they are protesting asking for more of this.The starter was very small in portion and we were told that they have now started the concept of portion size for starters as well. Noting that we ordered for a Large portion of Golden Garlic Fried Rice with Iceburg lettuce and Corn & potato - large portion, both of which have had an big cutdown on its portions.To add to that the server spilled rice on two out of four of us which is such a disaster.The bill as usual was huge. The summary is that the portions are lesser, taste is not as good as before, the service has terribly deteriorated and the cost continues to be very high",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or140-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune

30,18-Mar-13,Good Food bad Reception...!!!,"We reached the Place at 8.40 PM , as there was not arrangement for Valet parking ,we parked the Car in the basement of the building . There was no stairway to the top for Mainland China , we need to walk thru the same slope from which we came down with our car.We entered thru Main Entrance, Tiamangla was standing at the reception to greet us, she asked us if we have a reservation , I said yes at 9 PM. She check the register and told us to wait as table is getting ready.As we waited for around 3-4 minutes she asked us to come with her , she took us to a table near the Bar and close to the kitchen door.Manoj came to our table and asked us for the preference of our drinking water , bottled or normal. He gave us the food and drink menu.And filled our glasses with water.I ordered our Soup and maincourse dinner to Partho. Manoj brought the drink soup first and left the table, after 5 minutes he brought my drink , Ginger Pineapple frappe. the photo of the same in the attachment.After we finished out soup , we waited around 20 minutes minimum before someone served us the main-course.Mongil cleared our table and then severed us the main course. During our main course , when we needed help to serve the food, no one was around so we served it ourselves.After the main course was complete JEET KC came to our table and asked us if we like to have anything in desert, We asked him to bring the bill ,he esquire from us if we have SPECIALITY Card , we said we didn't have it right now.After 2-3 mins he presented the bill to us, I kept my credit card, and he brought the creditcard receipt, I signed it and left the place.Points of Concern:Too much noise from Kitchen . Both of utensils and people inside.Attendants were too much busy with other guest they forgot sometime that someone is waiting , in middle of there dinner.There was No Musicmain course dinner plate was not warmNo chinese tea offeredNo valetNo greetings",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or150-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune
40,26-Dec-12,Great food!,"Had organized a reunion of friends in this restaurant on christmas eve; and mainland china didnt disappoint us!Table booking was possible over phone and table was kept ready at required time. Staff helped us choose the right apetizers, drinks and the main course. Chicken in hunan style, crackling spinach were really tasty. Buffalo bull drink could've been better in terms of presentation.Service was satisfactory; at times I felt they could've responded a bit faster. Can be considered as an improvement opportunity.Overall, good food and good ambience!

40,17-Oct-12,Indian Chinese,"Went to this restaurant with friends yesterday. The interior is good, although perhaps a little minimalistic. I guess that's this chain of restaurants style.For those that think that this servers authentic Chinese, you will be disappointed. Mainland China serves Chinese food with an Indian twist. (ref. Indian Chinese cuisine at wikipedia).The food is good, and they have a multitude of dishes to choose from, ranging from mild to spicy. The seating arrangements are also good, and would suit couples, families and business dinners.For the kids, I guess the dessert menu is what they're all waiting for, and the desserts are really good.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or150-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune

20,17-Jun-12,Indianized Chinese Loaded with MSG,"This is a very popular chain for Indian Chinese cuisine in many parts of India. The reason for its popularity is of course because it caters to the vast majority of Indians who think of manchurian, hakka noodles, sweet corn soup and spring rolls as Chinese, specially if it comes loaded with MSG (most Indians have no clue what this is). If you tell the manager you want your food without MSG ( a very normal request in Chinese restaurants around the world), he will stare at you as if you have come from another planet! That should be your cue to walk out of the restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or160-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune
