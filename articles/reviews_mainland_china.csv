9,50,15 November 2016,Awesome Lunch,"Visited Goa for Honeymoon and stayed in Miramar Residency. Saw an advertisement in local newspaper about Mainland China's great buffet lunch offers. So me and my wife decided to have a lunch out there. Called the staff for a booking and a was provided a 1:30 pm slot. Now to mention, I have visited almost all the outlets (Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Bangalore) so I had in mind the quality of food I should expect. But, Mainland China @ Caculo Mall, Panjim surpassed it. Was welcomed by the staff at the reception area, got a table as per our convenience that too even when we reached the location by 1 pm. Starters were awesome and each and every item was wonderful. Being a bengali, I do understand the quality of fish in the very first bite. It was the best I had out of all the visits in various other branches all over the country. The lunch ended on a sweet note with some great deserts. Well had ICICI Credit card and got an extra 5% discount and a complimentary soft drink. Awesome food and very courteous staff made our day. Would certainly drop by for our next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g303877-d6563415-Reviews-Mainland_China_Caculo_Mall_Panaji_Goa-Panjim_North_Goa_District_Goa.html,Mainland China, Panaji, Goa

58,30,21 June 2014,Nice for a Sunday Lunch but Difficult to Park,"We went for the Sunday lunch buffet. We had gone quite early and so the restaurant was relatively empty and the service was good and attentive.Everything was hot and fresh as the buffet had just started. The Szechuan potatoes and the chicken dim sums were the firm favourites among the starters as was the chicken-egg drop soup. These were plentiful and tasty.As far as the main course went; the fish was very disappointing as was the chicken lollipops, but the noodles and the fried rice was good.As in most buffets in my experience, the desserts certainly leave something to be desired; honey flat noodles don't do well being left out for a long time, and calling mango soufflé a dessert, does not make it one!!!But all-in-all a very pleasant way to spend a Sunday lunch and one that we would repeat.One word of caution - parking at Caculo Mall is next to impossible, unless you happen to work there!!! So be prepared to look hard for parking nearby; not easy even on a Sunday!!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g303877-d6563415-Reviews-or50-Mainland_China_Caculo_Mall_Panaji_Goa-Panjim_North_Goa_District_Goa.html,Mainland China, Panaji, Goa

Be it the food or the service, they won't let you down at all. Food is top-notch with maintained authenticity to it. The place is located just opposite Infinity Mall and upon entering this lovely dining place you can notice the huge space. It's more of fine dining with a range of food options. They Al-a-carte as well as buffet style, so it's a personal choice with whatever is okay. When it comes to Asian food, they have great sushi options, mouth-watering dumplings, and scrumptious Thai delicacies. Also, they have introduced a new menu which I did try out and it was definitely one heavenly meal.Good portions to be precise, a single portion can be easily had by 2 people.Started off with few portions of ""Pan Fried BBQ Fish""""Lemon Grass Prawns""""Coriander Chicken"" This was the best.Even tried a range of dumplings and I have a thing for it anyways. Gotta recommend the ""Philadelphia Cheese Dumplings"" & ""Pan Fried Japanese Mushroom Dumplings"". Kudos to the chef for making such amazing food.The mains definitely had to tried and we had ""Lotus Leaf Rice"" accompanied by a decent portion of ""Chicken In Roasted Garlic Sauce"". Even tried a small portion of ""Singapore Style Fired Noddles with Bean Sprout"". A good amount of veggies, fabulous quantity, and the gravy complimented the rice and noodles. Worth it.We finished our meal on a very sinful and decadent note with a huge portion of ""Chocolate Dome"". Well presented and extremely well crafted. For those who love chocolate, this is a definite pick for them.Nothing to complain as if, since everything was just perfect. .",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

107,30,18 November 2017,Authentic Chinese Food,The food is really authentic and taste great to a lot of people but certainly not to all.

113,30,27 September 2017,Mainland China is now Asian Kitchen and Bar - not the same I am afraid!,"My son and I visited Mainland China at Sakinaka where we have dined more than once in the past and always enjoyed the excellent cuisine. This time however the restaurant is renamed to Asian Kitchen and Bar and the food, along with the decor and ambience, has suffered:/We started with an Eight treasure soup with chicken - which was surprisingly just ok, not great. The starters of Dynamite Prawn (ok) and soft shell crab (very good) were followed by Tempura Sushi roll (ok).For main course, the Truffle and Endamame fried rice with mixed meats was good as was the stir fried chicken in a sauce.On the whole the food was ok to good. But when you visit Mainland China anywhere in India what you expect is great food - always.

We've all had chinese food here and there at normal restaurants havent we? Wanna know where you can hog some of it in an actual chinese atmosphere? Well look no more, because Mainland China is the best place to visit to fulfill your cravings for Chinese food. Not to forget the place also offers some amazing Thai dishes. What I loved most about this place is that from the moment I stepped in, there was a vibe of China town around me. No kidding there. The beautiful writings and paintings on the walls with perfect lighting gave the place a warm and homely aura . The place is simply the one you should go for when you want to enjoy a hearty meal in peace with your friends, family and ofcourse with your umm.. date maybe?Moving on to the food. Here's something I'll tell y'll if you happen to visit this place. You HAVE to try out their Juicy Rambutan. They serve it to you in this huge bowl from which belches flamboyant white smoke appears to be coming out and THAT makes this simple yummy dish look so darn Classy! I have also tried their Sizzling brownie with hot Chocolate and its finger lickin' goodI really loved how every single dish was served to us by the staff in its actual way. They communicated with us really well , explained to us their best dishes when asked and helped us decide our order which turned out to be Incredibly Awesome!

120,30,14 August 2017,PLEASE AVOID THE BUFFET AVERAGE FARE AND GO ALA CARTE,"This restaurant earlier called mainland china was the flagship restaurant in mumbai at saki naka, andheri east.The buffet was very famous with lots of varieties and excellent taste.Now the renovated version with completely different interiors and instead of chinese only now pan asian cuisine is available along with chinese dishes.The buffet was just average cut down to limited range and plates becoming smaller in size.If it is done to avoid wastage by customers then fine.Completely average fare.Quality as well as variety.The service is very good and that is the only consolation prize. Price is pocket friendly.The renovated restaurant is spacious and the brightness of the sun from the windows has disappeared in the renovated restaurant.Drinks are okay.The concept probably is new but looks like will not be a winner.The whole new set up was not required to cater to pan asian audience as in India,pan asian is still in nascent stage.Chinese is more popular and is the earning revenue source for most of the restaurants.I was a bit disappointed as they have kept the prices of buffet reasonable but variety and quality missing.The ala carte menu is good and offers a reasonable variety .Some of the dishes were good.chicken and fish in ala carte was good.Overall rating -Food Quality and Variety - Buffet average , ala carte goodFood Taste - Buffet average , ala carte goodHygiene - GoodService and Courtesy - Very GoodInteriors - Spacious and average in grandeurPrice - Buffet reasonable , ala carte reasonable and a little high on some of the dishes.Repeat visit - Definitely No.The earlier restaurant I feel was excellent and was the Big Daddy of Chinese food.There are better options available nearby or visit their andheri west mainland china outlet which is still excellent although service during weekends is slow..I have an emotional connect with this restaurant going there since 1995 and enjoying the excellent buffet ,even my foreign guests from germany,france,italy uk,hong kong uae,used to love this restaurant and repeat every second third day which was called mainland china at that time known for its excellent chinese variety.However feel bad to say that this pan asian concept is not going to work and they are likely to suffer losses if they continue with this concept.The corporate crowd will go for drinks and ala carte but family crowd will reduce for sure with global fusion restaurant chain just 5 minutes drive offering sumptuous buffet and larger variety and portions with a little extra price,being a hot favourite for their variety .Even there are some more newly opened options in the same area offering chinese food and better quality and variety at reasonable price.The other option is to go their mainland china andheri west outlet which is still excellent and has sumptuous variety and excellent in quality and taste although service at andheri west outlet is very slow on weekends.You have to change with the changing times but after proper research and study of market.Disappointed completely.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or60-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

270,30,7 January 2016,Not quite as good as before,"Indian-Chinese is a fun concept and way better than the bland over-sweet gooey ""American Mall Chinese"" that has virtually no relationship with what people ACTUALLY eat in China! Indian-Chinese generally takes a lot of popular elements from Chinese cuisine and then spices it up to suit Indian tastes. For my money this works!Mainland China is somewhere I've been several times while visiting Mumbai and I would certainly go again. The concept would possibly be a little confusing for a first-timer, but basically, you are served a choice of starters and then you can visit the buffet yourself and, pretty much, eat more of what you've just been served.Buffets are not generally a great proposition, but this one largely works because the turnover of dishes is quite rapid. There's a nice selection of desserts too.My reason for saying ""not quite as good as before"" is a simple matter of cleanliness. Generally this is a very clean and well-presented establishment, but on the day of my most recent visit I thought the tables and buffet area were not as pristine as I had seen before. Not bad, but not special. For a buffet, I prefer ""special"" to ""not bad"". However, based on past experience I am willing to believe this was just an ""off day"" (not that a restaurant should ever permit ""off days"" - particular regarding cleanliness) and I will certainly go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or210-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Rather if other places are crowded in malls, I just step in to eat there knowing that the choices will be limited and the prices higher than other places that serve better Chinese food like China Gate. The starters are good but you never get squids. The noodles are just about okay and the menu is not really innovative any more. I think there is too much marketing around this brand when real foodies move on word of mouth. MLC is not a happening place anymore. Time for some real change.

337,10,25 August 2015,EIGHT TREASURE SOUP WITH A PIECE OF GLASS,"We had ordered for Eight Treasure Soup – Chicken, we having the soup we have found a piece of broken glass in the soup on my last spoonful or last bite I bit on to something hard. When I pulled it out to our surprise it was a Shard of Glass. I'm Furious! If I were to have swallow this. The amount of damage it could have cause would life threatening. I have told the waiter as well the restaurant manager on the same. They informed me that they will look into the matter. So they have not charged me for the soup.How can such a well know restaurant be so casual and careless regarding the food which is being served. Even the quality of the food at your Sakinaka is not the value for the money.The tax Invoice no : 5396 on 15th Aug time 23:22, Table no : 6, Pax : 4 personsEven after sending the hotel a mail 'yourviews@speciality.co.in & ''feedback@speciality.co.in', they are least bothered to reply and give a feed backhope any of you all reading this review should be careful while dining at Mainland China - Sakinaka.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or270-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Tried the entire range of dishes on offer-both vegetarian and non vegetarian options. We were pleased at the quality of ingredients they used that added crunch and flavors to the dishes,no mean feat to achieve in a Chinese buffet menu. The prices were very reasonable and we were surprised to be offered everything from soup,starters,main course,rice n noodles and scrumptious desserts for around six hundred rupees plus taxes.

369,40,29 June 2015,Wide variety of Oriental fare,"This place not only serves Chinese dishes, but in fact a variety of Oriental fare. It was a pleasant surprise to us to know this.I being a fan of Japanese fare ordered their Miso soup which could not be called perfect, but those who ordered the Chinese soups were very happy. So hastily we reached to a conclusion that these people are jack of all dishes and master of Chinese.We just stuck to the Chinese fare but later learned that the dishes of other countries were also nearly authentic and we could have indulged into them without any fear.A word of caution - we would like to add here - be careful about the serving portion - it is slightly more than you can imagine. So order carefully.The ambience is very good and service friendly.This being a fine dining restaurant definitely is slightly harsh on the pocket.We never had any prior reservations but were able to get the table immediately - maybe we were lucky.Should be tried at least once - we can guarantee this, you won't regret.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or300-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

374,30,19 June 2015,Disappointing...,"I have been to different Mainland China restuarants around India, but this one was disappointing. I have generally considered it as a fine dine , authentic Chinese resturant but, cant say the same for this experience. We ordered 4 starters, 2 main dishes between 4 of us and we struggled to finish. It wasnt the quantity though, it was the taste. Sauted mushrooms were flavourless and crackling spinach was too salty and sweet. Tofu was too oily. Fried rice felt like street chinese food and oriental sauce with veggies was average. Spicy garlic noodles were good but too dry. In the end, for the price we paid (approx Rs 900 per head), we went away dissatisfied. Its time, Mainland china authorities have a look at their quality before its too late.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or310-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

But why everything, really even the fried rice, must be totally infused in garlic is peculiar. It also means you often cannot taste the food because of the overpowering garlic. Also they don't know the concept of small portions - small should mean small - why waste food?",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or310-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Since it was a rainy day the restaurant had quite a few empty tables and was comfortable and spaced out. We started with some excellent khimchi and jasmine tea which certainly helped whet our appetite. For starters we had tofu plate, crackling spinach and marinated mushrooms. The mushrooms emerged as a clear favourite. Main course was exotic vegetables in chilli basil sauce along with fried rice and chilli garlic noodles. The noodles were quite tasty and clearly my best dish at the meal there. For a vegetarian meal without drinks we paid about ₹1000 per head.

383,50,5 June 2015,Guilin in mainland Chima,"A couple of years ago I made a trip to Guilin and was very impressed. I expected everyone to to dressed in Mao Tse Tung clothes but instead, walking around town you could have imagined w alking around a North American city. I can't remember the name of the hotel but it was very western like and very cheap --about 25.00 US/ night. I also took a boat up the Li Jiang river and that was very interesting. The scenery was much like Halong bay in Vietnam or Krabi in Thailand. Tetons rising all along the river. We returned to Guilin via the tour bost about halfway where we stopped a little souvenir town. I couldn't eat the food that came with lunch on the boat so I went into a little restsurant/bar type place hoping to get a sandwich and a coffee. A lady brought me the menu and the first three items were : dog-all kinds, snake all kinds, spicy pork penis. I closed the menu and just ordered a coffee.The little village was nest to walk around and then a bus took us from here to Guilin. I was very glad and super elated to find a McDonalds in Guilin and I was able to pretty much get around the food situation. I highly recommend a trip to Guilin. I got there by Dragonair out of Hong Kong. In hong Kong I was able to get a mainland and this was done for me by a travel agent in the hotel I was staying in (Hong Kong).",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or320-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

411,40,12 May 2015,Lip Smacking Oriental Cuisine,"Mainland China has established itself as a reliable brand for foodies who wish to enjoy Chinese and other South Asian fare at a mid-range pricing. Ofcourse the oriental fare is sufficiently 'Indianized' to suit evryone's palate.Their outlet at Vashi will fulfill your expectations on most counts. The minimalist décor without making the eatery a museum for Chinese artifacts is what sets it apart from other so called Chinese restaurants in Navi Mumbai. Anticipate a soothing ambiance. Serving staff is polite and knowledgeable.The lunch buffet is reasonably priced and provides sufficient variety from appetizers to desserts. The a-la-carte menu also provides an eclectic variety of Chinese and Thai cuisine. I’d recommend the lemon grass grilled chicken, pad thai noodles, pan fried chilli fish, their dim sums especially the sui mai prawn, stir fried chicken with chillies garlic and hot basil and their dim sum brunch buffet. For desserts, stick to the honey noodles in icecream.Overall a great place to enjoy a relaxed meal with family and friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or350-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
412,40,11 May 2015,"China the ""Indian way""","Entrance not really spectacular, going through a plain lobby and business elevator. Dining area is ok.We don't start well as they don't have even Chinese beer: Indian, Mexican, Dutch, others but no Tsingtao?! Good comes and on the table you find fork and spoon to eat. No chopsticks and not even the typical Chinese spoons. Not a good start.But then the starters came. The prawns were spectacular, non anywhere close to how you would eat them in China, but good. Tried to test them on Sichuan dishes. Spicy yes, but just in the form of more pepper, but not the typical Sichuan spices and flavors. Still very good. Conclusion: recommend to enjoy something ""good and different in India"" but not for ""I want the real Chinese food""",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or350-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

The quality and quantity have been both been maintained and the pricing is still reasonable for a restaraunt of this stature .The service can be sloppy at times , especially when you go during peak hours and there was an pleasant instance when our ' to be served food' was left to cool for quite some minutes on a counter shared with used plates ! However they were gracious enough to apologise and are always quick to volunteer a complimentary dessert which is a nice touch .Recommendations - them sweet and chilli prawns , steamed fish ( you can choose from pomfret, bekti or basa) in delicate sauces and the clay pot rice. Dessert try the chocolate rolls with ice cream. Sinful but delicious .... And for Dimsum lovers there is a full section of varieties ...Recommended !",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or370-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

The trio consisted of one Nepali, one UP-guy and one chap from one of the eastern states. They were literally hovering over us, yet unintrusively, explaining the dishes, asking about how spicy we wanted them to be, offering suggestions, etc.We started with a Miso Chicken soup, then followed up with a pair of starters, one veg (Tofu) and one non-veg (Chicken).

If the chef is able to tone down a little on the fierce dishes and get the food right, it would be a five star place. Every bite felt very strong and thus I couldn't eat so much.

488,40,21 December 2014,A fixture for over a decade!,"This review is going to be colored with a lot of sentimentality - because I've been visiting this restaurant from 2001. I must've eaten here 100s of times - office lunches, dates, family dinners or just hanging out with friends. Because for the longest of times, this was the only fine dining restaurant in the area. I have a lots of fond memories to the accompaniment of great meals. Now that this is Christmas time, I remember one year, when teenage carol singers circulated from table to table, spreading cheer, smiles and joy. :-) I order almost by rote these days: Peppery lemon soup, crackling spinach, steamed wantons, stir fry vegetables, chicken (pick any preparation), fried rice (pick any flavor) and date pancake with ice cream. Dependable food and great service - they behave as neighborhood restaurants should: remember you to the extent of where you sat last visit. :-) May the restaurant live long.

However, it was a surprise lunch get together planned by my wife on my Birthday, where a close friend and family were invited to Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai.The fact that we went there more for the get together rather than the food, help keep expectations low. In any case, we have been to other outlets of Mainland China, hence the novelty factor was not there.We got a good table for all of us and then the excellent service took over. Soups and a variety of starters kept coming to the table. For once, I did not miss being a non vegetarian as they had different kinds of veg starters as well.The buffet spread was equally good, though lesser dishes for vegetarians.

509,30,20 November 2014,Chindian buffet,"I'm a purist when it comes to Chinese food but accept that most Indians prefer their food spiced. By now I've been to Mainland China, the Bandra as well as the Versova/ Andheri West branch, several times, It's usually when i was invited for a get together and it's nearly always the lunch buffet. For myself I'd prefer a more authentic place. The positives , if you like that sort of thing, are that the starters are seemingly endless and served at the table constantly. The waiters are very helpful and attentive , even with difficult guests and badly behaved children. There is a great volume of food..once you're through with starters, you have very little room for anything else. So if you are a huge eater, that is good value. The not-so-positives are that the food is smothered in spicy gravies and sauces, lots of oil, what the Bombayite would call ""chatpata"" flavours. The place is full, even on the weekdays we 've been and everybody generally likes it. Unfortunately I don't. There is not a single thing on the buffet that I would choose to order a la carte, and nothing is memorable or worth returning for. Lots of food, lots of spice. Maybe I would be better off ordering from the menu but since I'm generally stuck with a group and the buffet, that has not happened. For true Chinese I'd prefer Hai Bao, Lings, Royal China, so its not likely that I'd risk going here even for a la carte",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or440-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Lamb, Chicken, Tofu... Hot & sour soup etc etc... and the tea.. we were delighted when the visitors said all these are 100% authentic food and would match any restaurant in Singapore or Shangai as original !!! They felt probably the Chef is from China... they confirmed the interior carried original Chinese alphabets (not the simplified one) and declared this is authentic and commented this is a very good job.. unlike America where you get food that has no connection with original.Good Job to Management of MLC for ensuring authenticity.

Don't miss to taste them as well.Even if they forget to serve Chinese tea, ask for it and do taste!!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or470-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

552,40,30 September 2014,ALWAYS SATIATED,Mainland China is one restaurant where you will never go wrong. Their food quality is top most and of consistent taste. They use the best of the herbs and the preparation of all dishes is awesome. Many of their dishes you will never find in the run of the mill chinese restaurants.I like their unfixed menu concept where they serve the buffet at your table- from a wide variety to choose from. Also their unlimited buffet too is good with the fish taking the pride of place. The expensive spread with dessert is less than US$ 10 !!To top it the decor and ambience is upscale thereby providing the entire experience as top value for money.And if you celebrating a birthday- the staff will happily send a complimentary cake and put on the birthday song too.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or490-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
553,50,30 September 2014,Fine Dining in Fine China,"MC Andheri is one of my favourite places to eat. The ambiance is great - from China silk curtains to fine latticework in wood- overall a nice classy touch. Their Service is very cordial - they always smile and accommodate you try and fit you in a spot of your choice. But the best thing about MC is their food! They are absolutely standardised, yet fresh in their condiments, in the taste, in the texture and tone. The food is never too salty or too spicy or too anything and it is a pleasure to tuck in. I suggest you go just a quarter hour before the crowd comes in ( and it does!) - around 1230 for Lunch and 745 for Dinner. Also ask them for any off the menu dishes thay they may have introduced but not put on menu. I found some lovely one ( potato cubes for e.g.) like that.

Just rightly done so to say.We had a guest from the USA and she was so enamoured with the delectable food there, that she said that she will tell anyone visiting Mumbai, India that they must have a meal at the Mainland.I think that goes to say that I need not write a single word more!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or510-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Whether it is a business luncheon or a family dinner - the experience has more or less been the same. So you do crave to go here for Chinese food.However the recent visit was a run down experience - no complaints on the ambience and the service - it was the taste of food and the dressing that put us off and this was true for all the dishes ordered except the desert (honey noodles and vanilla ice cream). The chicken fat had not been appropriately cooked and the chicken meat was also not well cooked which spoilt the taste of the food.Hope not to have such a repeat performance at any Mainland China restaurant.RegardsKhozema Anajwalla",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or510-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

He was confusing us more. I had ordered for mineral water and for 10 minutes the water was not even brought even after repeated reminders. The soup was ugggh , too salty and hardly any chicken ...The starters were squishy and not upto the mark.To top it all they charge VAT at rates higher than what is stated in the act and the manager Mr. Abhishek was the rudest person I have ever metThe service needs to improve drastically.

Average crispies, lower than average Thai spring rolls, a coffee lime sorbet that tasted suspiciously like the ubiquitous jasmine tea and hard brownies.

We didn't go for the set menu & took the suggestions given by the restaurant.The ambience of this outlet is really good. It has a lot of open spaces that are well lit & still provide enough privacy for the guests. I really liked the decor.The food was really yum but did have its downs. We order 2 starters & 2 main courses along with a soup. The soup - seven sea soup which is a seafood soup was yum but had almost no seafood. The restaurant however did provide some crab meat but it was after they served the starters and the soup was cold.The starters a fried shrimp & a pan fried basa fish were delicious but the fish was a little too oily for our taste.For the main course we order burnt garlic fried rice & pan fried noodles. Again these dishes were spot on in flavor & presentation.Overall it was a good experience at Mainland & I would definitely like to visit.

609,50,14 April 2014,Can't fault Mainland China,I have been eating at this location since it opened almost 20 years ago. The food still tastes the same which is fantastic. The a la carte is always better than the buffet but that you can say about most Asian buffets because the corn flour in the food makes the food lose its appeal after it sits on the counter for a while. The service has always been best in class. Crackling spinach is an all time favourite. It's one of the first Mainland Chinas and worth a definite visit if you're in the vicinity. Disclaimer: Don't be put off by the location. Its proved lucky for them and the proof lies in the fact that this branch is still doing roaring business.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or540-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Rs. 380.00Star of the day!I would have preferred more curry powder and less of turmeric.Noodles cooked just right, with a balanced medley of carrot sticks, green capsicums, crunchy beansprouts and spring onions. A bit of fried fermented tofu would have taken the dish to another level.Will definitely order next time with request to up the curry powder and add tofu.Food quantity was more than adequate for a couple and was neatly packed in heat sealed transparent plastic trays. Commendable!The pickled cabbage & cucumbers, sauces and condiments are packed in individual zip locks pouches which are placed in a stapled plastic bag.

Had to wait a lot for getting a repeat of the starters specially if you need dimsums. thus general advise is to take more rather than to wait :) I know it sounds cheap but thats what can be done if you dont like waiting for your food.The chocolate syrup fountain is really cool to use.Overall very satisfied & will keep visiting eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or550-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

They serve the most delicious and best Chinese food in town (atleast as we Indians like to eat it.....wouldn't know about authenticity and don' care either). Their soups, starters, main course...everything is excellent. They have choice of servings, which ensures that we don't order more than required. The staff is helpful in suggesting the dishes as well as portions depending on our requirements and service is fairly quick once you get a seat. Its a bit noisy during weekends but comfortable.

635,50,11 March 2014,"If it is Chinese, it has to be Mainland China - absolutely!","The place for authentic chinese food. Great hospitality and warmth in service, no better place than MLC for a quiet dinner or a family get-together. I have been to MLC restaurants in Mumbai (Tardeo, Bandra and Oshivara), Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chandigarh and was never disappointed - great service,, quality food and nice ambience. However, the Oshivara restaurant in my view wins hands down. Try the range of dimsums (steamed dumplings), eight treasure soup (veg or Non-veg), the corn-cheese cubes that melt in your mouth and leave you aksing for more and the delicious crackling spinach! That give your meal a great start. Main course variety has a wide range and desserts are innovative - must not miss the hot chocolate rolls with ice cream and the date ice cream! MLC truly gets you addicted and once you have a meal there, the tagline is resounding - if it is Chinese, it has to be Mainland China!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or570-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

I have been frequenting Mainland China at different locations in the country over last 15 years. The flavor and taste have distinct. The service is friendly with all young boys from our side employed to mimic an authenticity. While I like almost everything in the menu, the rising price and very quick lapse of specialty preferred point have been a disappointment of late.

Cost is on the higher side ( 6 small pieces Rs 210). The accompanying sauces are also very good. Basil one need a special mention. Thereafter we went for buffet vegetarian. The other starters like stirred fried vegetables ( wonderful) and vegetable money bags were also offered. The soup was a disappointment. The main cause was a nice fried rice. Right texture and consistency. Four vegetables to accompany and all the 4 were very good. Another main course was a garlic chilly noodle. Good, but fiery on the palate. Vide variety of desserts were offered. One among them ( which is similar to fried noodles and honey- but not exactly the same) merits a special mention.

The lighting is soft and just correct. If you are celebrating a Birthday, the staff pops out a Guitar and strums up a few notes on it; a nice way to make you feel special.SERVICE - 5/5Just one word; IMPECCABLEI don't think I can find a fault with their service. Welcome Drinks offered on arrival. We were ushered to our table without a delay. Napkins from the table were unfolded and laid on our lap. Plates were laid and the starters started flowing; I am using the word ""flowing"" coz they literally flowed without a break. We had to tell the stewards to stop till we finished. Half eaten plates were promptly replaced and sauces replenished. The Stewards also insisted that we try some of their speciality dishes.Could we ask for a better service? A Special Thanks to Bryan for making our every visit special.FOOD - 4.5/5All I can say is that the FOOD IS DIVINE. There isn't a single dish on the menu which disappoints. I have been here for the Sunday Lunch Buffet and actually kept myself hungry since morning to enjoy the entire spread. The food flows in your plate from the moment you sit and till the time you say STOP, it keeps flowing.MUST HAVE's:1. Crackling Spinach2. Chicken Taipei - The best Chicken preparation in Chinese I have had so far.3. Dimsums - Couldn't be better.4. Fish in Mango & Mustard Sauce - Can you imagine Mango being used in a Fish preparation. You have to eat it to believe it. WOW!5. Chilli Garlic Noodles6. Fish in Chilli & Plum Sauce7. Caramel Custard - Another Beauty. The only other place where you get such a lip-smacking Caramel Custard is in some old Irani Restaurant in SoBo.8. Darsaan with Chocolate Fondue.PRICE - 4.5/5Worth every penny you spend.

678,40,25 December 2013,"Mainland China - Kandivali E,Mumbai","Having visited their outlets across Andheri, Powai & Kandivali(E) in Mumbai several times & dined A-la-carte as well as Buffet options, here's my review based on my latest visit which is TODAY at the Kandivli E outlet & our choice was the Veg-Buffet. Since it was a holiday, as expected the place was packed, while we had done a prior booking, on arrival we were told the booking is not in place (!!!)...anyway all's well that end's well. In a few mins we got a nice table & as expected the food was good. Dim-sums are as always the best & as a vegetarian we may find few choices in the main course, the freshly sautéed exotic vegetables in a mild sauce were a nice change, paired with Celery & Lettuce Fried rice. Desserts - kids find the chocolate fountain so enticing & the usual staples like ice-creams, mousse, tiramisu, honey noodles, brownie and fresh fruits for the health conscious. So my verdict for the day : FOOD - nice, AMBIENCE - nice...particularly on a day like this it's a test in patience for all staff, so i'ts great that we could dine peacefully without any unwanted attention, SERVICE - good, but for the confusion in booking i would have said excellent.

690,50,14 October 2013,Go nowhere else for Chinese!,"Mainland China's my only choice in Mumbai for Chinese food. From what I've heard it's more North East Indian Chinese than authentic Chinese (having never been to any part of China - mainland or otherwise, I have no way of authenticating this) but irrespective of the origin, the food tastes really good. I've lost times of the number of times I've been but every time, the crackling spinach, the dimsum, the green chutney accompaniment, the crispy chicken, the lamb, the seafood - every single time, all the dishes never fail to impress.Of all three outlets I've been, the Saki Naka one reigns supreme inspite of the location and lack of parking. Their set lunch weekday menu is ridiculously low priced for the quality and if you're celebrating a b'day or anniversary, just let them know and they'll make a nice fuss of the b'day person with a cake, candle, song, etc.Mainland China's the only Chinese place where I look forward to dessert - their honey noodles and their chocolate rolls are excellent.Oh and make sure you reserve a table on weekends - or be prepared to wait for a really, really long while!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or630-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

The crackling spinach is a legendary preparation here and is beautifully spiced. Oh and it does really crackle. Love it.My favourite main course is the Tsing hoi style corn and potatoes. It is loaded with cashew-nuts and fiery red chillis and they somehow complement each other amazingly. This dish goes best with the hakka noodles.The sweet and sour veggies with crispy noodles is another notable preparation.Mainland China also offers an excellent variety of beverages. Good wine collection too.If you choose to eat dessert, I recommend the honey noodles with vanilla ice cream. Simple, but wonderful.My experience is that the service can have its ups and downs.Expect to spend about 800Rs per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or630-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai
692,40,17 September 2013,Good food at many outlets,"I've been to two Mainland China restaurants so far. They have quite a few outlets in Bombay and in other cities in India.When eating at Chinese restaurants in India, I find they fall into three categories. The top, upscale Chinese restaurants often very good at a price, the mid range restaurants, often with local influence in the food, and then the bottom rung Indianised Chinese restaurants, stalls and eateries.Of the mid range Chinese restaurants, Mainland China is among the better ones.The food is relatively authentic though some of their dishes have been altered to local taste.Service is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or630-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

They have a separate dining space that can be booked for 14-16 people.The food has been consistent throughout ..had been to their saki Naka, bandra and powai outlets quite often. However their menu in Delhi restaurants is quite different.The dim sums are a must try. One dish of the menu is chicken supreme ( comes with celery and pepper). They are very courteous enough to make for us every time we go.The seafood menu is excellent. Try the crabmeat and the lamb starters also.The prices are reasonable and in some items offer different size portions( regular and large)Powai branch also offers the weekdays buffet which is reasonable. But if you want to experience the weekend buffet go their and hero west lokhandwala branch. It offers the best spread.I would recommend all Chinese lovers for mainland china.

694,50,14 September 2013,"Delicious, Economic Chinese food","I have lost the count of my visits to Mainland China. I love this place & especially lunch buffet. As one of its outlets is close to my work place it has been our first choice for celebrating any occasion. Some of the USPs of mainland china:•Lunch Buffet costs only appx 300 to 400 rs pp. Weekends are little over this price range.•Reasonably good spread of buffet.•Nice ambiance•Prompt service•Yummy Chinese food & not Indian Chinese food.I love soups, dim sums & Chinese tea which they serve. Starters come in good variety & are served at table. Main course is very limited. Normally its one rice , one noodle dish & veg /non veg gravy however once you are full with starters you won’t need it much. In deserts there are 3 flavours of ice creams, chocolate fountain, some assorted pastries. Overall its delicious & economic buffet.Al a carte menu is fabulous though its little expensive. There you get good variety as compared to buffet.Some points to consider:1.in my knowledge there is no dinner buffet. Buffet option is only for lunch.2.no corporate discount on buffet.3.if you are a frequent visitor like me to mainland china then you might find the lunch buffet boring after some visits as the menu is almost the same every day which minor changes.4.during lunch time almost on all the days ( at least kndivali outlet) this place is crowded. hence on a safe side book your table if you are going in a big group.To summarise I recommend this place to all.

Impressive !The setting is very Oriental and spacious, leaving good space for patrons to move about without disturbing others. The lighting is soft and just correct.SERVICE - 5/5Just one word; IMPECCABLEI don't think I can find a fault with their service. Welcome Drinks offered on arrival. We were ushered to our table without a delay. Napkins from the table were unfolded and laid on our lap. Plates were laid and the starters started flowing; I am using the word ""flowing"" coz they literally flowed without a break. We had to tell the stewards to stop till we finished. Half eaten plates were promptly replaced and sauces replenished. The Stewards also insisted that we try some of their speciality dishes.FOOD - 5/5All I can say is that the FOOD IS DIVINE. There isn't a single dish on the menu which disappoints. I have been here for the Sunday Lunch Buffet and actually kept myself hungry since morning to enjoy the entire spread. The food flows in your plate from the moment you sit and till the time you say STOP, it keeps flowing.On the whole, a nice sophisticated place serving good food, a warm and lovely ambiance.I am definitely visiting again :)",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or630-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Mainland China has multiple outlets across Mumbai - the best ones being Bandra West, Powai and Andheri East. The ambiance, friendly service, good food and good pricing all gets a thumbs up. Be warned though on weekends, the restaurant can get very noisy especially when certain outlets (like the Bandra one) host the weekend buffet. If you can live with that, you're in for a good meal.

708,40,20 August 2013,Gourmands who love 'Indian Chinese' will feel at home here,"Mainland China is one of those restaurant chains that have done well by catering to the public's taste for 'Indian Chinese' - mainly chicken dishes that are mildly spicy, with generous helpings of butter garlic sauces.Went here with friends who are regulars on a weekday. The lunch buffet costs Rs 700 bucks per head and if one shamelessly gorges on starters and desserts, it is extremely 'paisa wasool'. They make some delicious boneless chicken in different sauces and the waiters unobtrusively refill your plates. The fish and prawns in different Chinese sauces turn out to be quite decent.I usually judge a place by the quality of fish they serve and both the prawns and fish (presumably Basa) were quite fresh. For obvious reasons of economy, the fish and prawns in the starters make a late entry when patrons would have stuffed themselves with chicken and vegetables. But since all three of us who went for lunch were pretty hungry, we pestered the waiters to repeat the prawns and fish several times.The vegetarian starters we nibbled at for sample sake were pretty okay, but no match for the prawn/fish items.The buffet table also had more chicken and prawns items, but the dry crab in a white sauce turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately, we could find many crab bellies and we had to search hard for its meat.Desserts too had several varieties, but the miniature caramel pudding was classic. Served in a small matka, the puddings the size of carrom board coins were warm and delicious.All in all Mainland China is value for money. I am told that the quality of food at their outlet in Kandivli and elsewhere do not match what you get at Andheri.

They have adopted it quite well for the Indian tastes without losing the originality of the preparations!I've visited the outlets at Bandra (above Shoppers Stop) and in Malad (Infinity 2 Mall). Ambience is great however the Bandra one is much more spacious and laid back, The servers are quite helpful in selecting the menu, specify your choice to them and let them suggest their best offerings. I went with their suggestions and loved the choice that they made for us.At the both the occassions, we had a birthday celebration, and they arranged for a lovely Brownie Cake , with candles and the works and also served us a bottle of Sparling Wine , All this ON THE HOUSE !! Wow! Really nice of them! So would suggest that its an excellent place to go in for Celebrations, however book in advance and let them know about the occassion so that they can have things in placeDim Sums are a must have's here, and i was lucky to have visited the Bandra outlet, when they had a Dim Sum festival going on.Also loooved the chilly garlic noodles, its was fab and hot !

It is very Indian in style, preparation and taste. That being said, the food is very good. The restaurant offers a variety of veg and non-veg dishes, and seems to specialise in banquets for large groups. The dim sum dumplings were reasonably authentic, the rest I would not have picked as Chinese had I not been in a restaurant called Mainland China. Appetizers were mainly fried - the best being the deep fried corn. We had so many appetizers served that I didn't get to the mains, but the rest of my group found them ""Unusual but tasty"".Mainland China is worth a visit if only to see how Indians interpret Chinese food.

Mainland china in Mumbai is a place which has supirior quality service and ambience however lacks in food quality.With drinks we had ordered Drums of Heaven.Though nicely cooked but it lacked the crunch one usually has. Our mocktails were not mixed well and there was some goof-up also on the order.Chicken in black pepper was supossed to be very chilly but was below par.

It was perfect balancing of spiciness and sweetness. Even for me who is from Mongolia that doesn't eat spice at all, it was beautifully spiced. Then we had lamb for main.

As soon as we entered all of us were impressed with the spaciousness and the Decor. Truly spectacular. We were six of us and were allotted one of the finest tables in the restaurant. We started with the Lemon and coriander soup.....truly subtle and fired up our taste buds for further courses. The soup was followed by veg corn dim sums! Subtle again and left us asking for more. On to the main course, consisting of Lotus leaf wrapped almond rice (steamed), a delicate and tasty vegetarian dish with silken tofu......I mean it, the tofu was one of the best we ever had, and another spicy vegetarian dish. delectable, to say the least. Finally, we had to find out a suitable dessert for the vegan, remember? No problems, the waiter suggested the date 'ice cream'. Wow! delicious and guess what...subtle again!! To sum up, we all had a wonderful dinner experience and our vegan guest commented that it was the best Chinese meal he ever had in India!!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or670-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

741,40,17 April 2013,China Man,"If you are an Indian and prefer a heavy blend of Indian version of Chinese cuisine then stay away from this place. It strives to serve good Chinese food perfectly adapted to Indian palate.After an hiatus of about 6-7 years I visited the Franchise opposite to Infinity 1 (Link Road, Oshiwara) with my family and we were not disappointed. The personalised service (thanks to Ashok) made me feel at home as soon as I was seated. Ashok also taught my son to use the chopsticks which made him feel good too.The menu card (tablet) was heavily filled with fish items with a few chicken and lamb dishes. But I guess, the chef wouldn't have minded if something was ordered out of your imagination. The service was quick (maybe because it was an odd weekday), yet I presume it wouldn't differ much on weekends. The chicken dumplings (Momo's) had one of the thinnest coat that I have eaten in some time. A simple dish like Fried Rice and Schezwan Rice too were well made.The ambience is perfect for a family outing though the tables appeared to be slightly cramped for more seating place, yet no complaints regarding it.

On weekends and especially during lunch hours, do remember to male an appointment before ending up at the restaurant as otherwise you will have a waiting period of atleast 15-20 minutes.The hotel is not child friendly, but they do accomodate the whims of some children. We have a well mannered daughter who doesn't fly around but I have seen some kids who bring in a tornado along with them and its quite interesting to see the mix of business crowd reactions vis-a-vis family reactions.The food is a wee bit expensive but the portions are quite sumptuous.

883,30,27 April 2012,Going downhill,"Mainland China started off with a reputation of having excellent choice of dishes which were different from other Chinese restaurants. However, now that they have expanded to multiple locations in many cities, the fare has become very standardized. Their buffets are value for money but they tend to fill you with loads of starters so that you don't have much space for the main course (and more expensive) items.

890,30,17 April 2012,I-Pad for Menus? Not sure about this one...,I must admit when I was handed the electronic menus it felt jarring against the backdrop of dated decor. They could have invested in sprucing up the dining area instead of gadgetry whose novelty wore off within minutes of checking out whether Google Maps worked or not. Lol.But the main purpose of visiting a quality restaurant is its food. I was pleased that all but one of our chosen order was delicious. Staff were friendly. The ambiance varies from the three segments of the building you're in. The waiting area near the entrance was okay as long as you're limited in number. Very impersonal once other guests join you.To the right is a narrow dining area which appeared cramped yet cosy at the same time. We requested to be seated in the main dining area by which was in full occupancy - definitely a good sign. Fine dining experience? Definitely not. You will not be disappointed if you're prepared for an average meal. Price compared to the UK makes it quite reasonable although I understand its not cheap generally at app £20 (UK pound sterling) per head.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or830-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

The only intersting dish in main course was the 'live' mix veggies. To top it up, a loud gang of ladies was playing housie in the restaurant!

But an hard to digest fact was that I was not served water even after multiple requests which is the least you could expect from a class restaurant like this.We started with the dimsum platter. It did not tickle my taste buds. We immediately went to the cantonese noodles which was wholesome for 3 of us. As usual I always prefer four treasure vegetables because of shetake mushrooms which I love beyond anything. We ended the dinner with a well deserved Hot chocolate brownie.

I would say that soups are ordinary, starters are good but the main course is not of desirable taste and quality.

919,50,11 February 2012,For A Great Dining Experience,"Mainland China has several restaurants at Mumbai and those include the old one at Saki Naka and the relatively newer one at Powai. Both of these restaurants deliver the same exquisite dining experience - though the one at Powai is at a location that is less noisy and easier to reach and find parking. Mainland China delivers a great dining experience every time a customer visits them. The interiors have been made with great attention to detail and make the restaurant seem to be in China, not India, with different objects evoking a Chinese atmosphere. The staff is courteous, friendly and efficient. The menu is well presented and the options of both food and drink are many, including for vegetarians. As the food seems made afresh, it takes time after being ordered but every dish is made to perfection and tastes great. Though there can be debates about how authentically Chinese a restaurant can be in India, it is quite clear that Mainland China has steered clear of Indo-Chinese cuisine and delivers a different Chinese cuisine in India. The prices are moderate compared to the ambience and the great food. For any dining occasion, Mainland China is a good option.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or850-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Nothing we have tried here has been anything less than mouth wateringly divine.Choices for vegetarians are also more than adequate, No MSG is a definite option, and the waiters are happy to assist to ensure you choose well from the vast menu.Prices are certainly not low, but you do get what you pay for in every respect.Mainland China has acquired institution status, especially in Bombay, thanks to its unfailingly high standards.We look forward to going there again .......",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or860-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

It was hard to say if we were more hungry or upset .... but sanity prevailed when we realised that jumping off at this stage will mean waiting again at some other place.

947,50,9 January 2012,"The best set menu, fantastic service, simply outstanding","My parents visit the Mainland China at Sobo Central often and my mom informed me of their set menu special in which they offered any choice of soup*, 2 veg & 2 non-veg* appetizers, 2 veg & 2 non-veg* main course dishes, 1 type of rice and 1 type of noodle along with 2 desserts. *no special dishes such as prawns, lobsters, crabs.The price was way below my expectations and hence I called to confirm the details. Amazingly, Raajith confirmed the same over email and I was more than happy to book a table for my 16 guests at their Sobo Central outlet.When we arrived, we were promptly seated and assigned around 3-4 stewards who would look after our needs. We were immediately served their day's special appetizer made of spinach complimentary. The children were kept busy with a complimentary brownie with ice-cream. Soon the soups arrived (each of your guest can suggest his own choice within the extensive menu, but obviously the more choices, the longer it takes to serve). As the soup bowls were cleared, they started serving our chosen appetizers. The spicy lamb was very tasty and so was the fish in lemon coriander sauce (not sure of the name of the dish). The vegetarian appetizers were equally tasty.Just having completed their round of appetizers my guests were surprised that there were yet another 4 main course dishes waiting to be served. Once again, each and every dish was outstanding including the fried rice which many restaurants get wrong. After all this food, finally came the desserts and even though everybody was stuffed to the extent of bursting, nobody could resist the honey noodles and chocolate balls with ice-cream.Lastly, as a good will gesture, Raajith even offered me a bottle of sparkling white wine in appreciation of our patronage.Anybody who is exploring hosting a dinner for their guests must surely consider Mainland China and reach out to Raajith and leave the rest in his and his team's hand to enjoy a wonderful evening.The only thing that I could've hoped for, but wasn't possible with the current interiors of the restaurant is a table that was set in more of a square shape than a long table, as the square would've allowed easier interaction amongst the 18 of us.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or880-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

Unfortunately it was the latter for us.We were a group of 8 adults for lunch. It was a la carte and to be honest the appetizers were fantastic, which might have raised our expectations for our main meals. The mains left much to be desired - from the general t'sao chicken to the various lamb dishes. Everything was either watery or extremely bland.In terms of the service - we had to ask three times for our soups, finally the manager came over and all he did was stare at us and then went away. Shortly after the soup did arrive (along with the main meals).For 7 mains and 5 appys the bill came up to 9000 rs/-.I do have to mention that the bathrooms are the cleanest public bathroom I've seen in India (outside of the major hotels).

This was very annoying .Have the Chicken Dimsum platter for starters and if you love sea food, go for the Spicy Hunan Prawns. For the main course you could try the Sichuan fried rice with Minced chicken.

No such luck this time - only kimchi, sweet vinegar cucumber and the chilli sauce.The food still remains good, and we love the steam wontons. Kids ate a hakka noodles, but I liked the Singapore Noodles better.

We explained that we know what Peking duck is all about having lived in Beijing for some time, and that we have had good Peking Duck in Mumbai, at Royal China and that the meal put before us simply did not look palatable and we were not going to accept it. This could have been sorted professionaly by the manager but instead he and a colleague kept insisting it was fine. We of course, asked for the bill (of previous drinks) and left. Not once did any of the numerous managers standing around the restaurant make any attempt to soothe our concern or make any attempt at all to look after us as customers. I will never go back to this restaurant again. There is no management understanding at all of what customer service is all about.

The staff, in which I would include everybody, the waiters, floor manager etc, are very friendly and welcoming. This is the only place where I would not mine waiting 45 minutes to get a table (though it has not happened yet.)Coming to the food, the fare is fantastic. Each time I have visited, I have tried different dishes (mostly veg) and am yet to find one about which there is a fallacy.The ambience of the place is very well done. I would also ask future visitors to try their hands on eating with chopsticks. In case you have a problem, the staff would help you get trained for it. A failure even after that will find you a friendly waiter bringing kids' chopsticks (tied on the back for support)Prices are not exactly cheap, but not very pricey either. And once you visit, you would find the prices to be worth the experience.

It was very relaxing,an ambience who roars and shouts all about 'AWESOME CHINESE'. Therestuarant serving boys , we saw them going around with Tea pots andserving many at the table during lunch which we indians dont do much,tea along with lunch. I was wondering at that, when my friend said that 'Its free' and the told me the scientific funda of 'Tea' aidingdigestion as chinese meal gets a little heavier on our stomach.We then ordered soups and starter, and the best part was about the starter, it was golden fried corn, it was too very delicious to be described in a review, i suggest you try it for yourself. We liked the starters so much that we actually wished, we could only eat straters, but it being peak lunch hours, and we couldnt bear our hunger, we ordered pot rice and curry which was also, very nice. Then even enjoyed one-one relishing cup of tea along wth our lunch. We really enjoyed this experience.On our way back to exit door, we all received sweet cookies and guess what we all got a hidden message, inspiring ones in each of our cookies, we read it and the cookie and left from there.Must Try Place",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d806558-Reviews-or970-Mainland_China-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Andheri, Mumbai

The manager Om was very helpful throughout.We tried Lung fung soup with egg white and Dynamite wasabi prawns as starter. Both of them were mind blowing.. The soup was a clear soup and tasted so healthy. Om suggested a drink for summertime which called Mandarin Swirl drink .. it was such refreshing that is perfect for a summer time. After that I tried Pan fried Japanese mushroom and Chiken dumplings .. I never had such tasty dumplings before.In the main course we had Lotus leaf wrapped rice with corn kernels and almonds,Cantonese style rice noodles with Thai curry And Fish pickle coriander sauce. All of the food were lip smacking . A special mention for the Fish pickle in coriander sauce .. it had a tangy taste which spiced up the whole dining experience.

1049,40,5 December 2018,Pre-Birthday Lunch,"The pre-birthday celebrations began with a relaxed weekday lunch with the in-laws at Mainland China. This was our first visit to the Kandivali outlet and it was a good one indeed.The best part about weekday lunches is, that you have the entire place for yourself. We were immediately shown to our table by our humble host, Shravan, who made sure that we had a quality time. The tab menus are bulky, uncomfortable, hence I generally prefer the traditional paper ones. However, the tabs in MC came with a finished picture of the dish, which was a thoughtful touch to the menu.The lunch started off well with a quick round of Thai Style Chicken Dumplings and Prawn Siu Mai w/ lemon grass. Both the appetizers came out steaming, with the respective protein succulent, and the entire mouthful juicy. A special mention to the subtle flavors of lemon grass that left a refreshing note. Based on the recommendation from our host, we opted for the large portions of Singapore Rice Noodles and Cantonese King Prawns Hubei style. I can safely proclaim that we had the best rice noodles. For those who prefer to have some bite in their noodles, you might not entirely enjoy the rice noodles, and you might want to stick with the regular version. The prawns themselves were king-sized, but the gravy felt a bit flat in with its taste. Probably we didn't choose the sauce properly.With the main courses out of the table, we did manage to squeeze a dessert, which was a theater in itself. The chocolate dome gave away, as soon as the warm sauce made contact with it. The best part about this dessert came in the form of caramel popcorn on the side. A spoonful of the snappy chocolate dome, ice-cream, warm sauce, and few kernels of popcorn made for an interesting bite.We were surprised with an Apple, Orange, and Mint drink by the staff, which was refreshing after an indulgent lunch. In the end, we settled a bill of Rs.1800/-, which included a Zomato Gold discount. A great place to enjoy some amazing Chinese without pinching the wallet.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304554-d4570289-Reviews-Mainland_china_growel_mall_kandivali_east_mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Kandivali, Mumbai

The lunch buffet is sumptuous and the staff is generally attentive and cordial. There is a never ending supply of piping hot starters which are fresh and yummy. For the first time at the buffet lunch we also got crab beside the regular fish and chicken. My only contention or disappointment was that the food trays were empty and the staff had to be told to refill it . They not only did so but served it in bowls on the table. There was no one to welcome or see off too --which are common courtesies seen there earlier. The management need to buck up because there are other competitors in Cantonese food now.

The restaurant offers decent choices in deserts as well and you should try their 'Chocolate Brownie'.A Tip - The restaurant offer ala carte as well as the buffet however my suggestion would be to go for ala carte as buffet is not very lavish and items don't get replenished in time which at times can put you off.

Crispy Corn Chilly Pepper and Sr Stuffed Bread Curried Veg were served within 9 minutes 45 seconds of giving the order. The starters were tasty and were appropriately apportioned between two guests.The plates were changes after we completed the starters. The staff had a piece of sponge with which he cleared the food remaining on the table.Server did not offer us chopsticks at the start of the meal or anytime during the meal. The main course plate was at room temperature. The main course was served after 21 minutes. After 19 minutes agent reminded Pawan about the order and he informed the same would be served in next two minutes. Again after agent had the starter, glass was empty for around eight minute.

1157,40,23 August 2018,Most authentic Chinese restaurant,"We have been a regular at Mainland China since many years now. While many restaurant chains have come and gone, this one has weathered the times with aplomb. The food and service quality - two most important aspects of any restaurant, have remained great all through. The ambience, decorations and other paraphernalia come second and I have seen very many new eateries focussing more on these than the actual food. But the food at Mainland China remains uncompromised.As a regular connoisseur though, what bothers me is the menu price has been hiked quite a lot over the years. It has now become one of the most expensive Chinese restaurants in Navi Mumbai. A meal for two easily costs between 2500 to 3000. When Chinese food is generally associated with affordability and where there are several competitors offering them at 1/3rd the price, their pricing seems to be quite an anomaly.However, if you want to keep value concerns on the backburner and enjoy authentic Chinese cuisine, then there is none better than Mainland China.My all time favourites are crab soup, Zuchhini spring rolls, Drums of heaven, teriyaki chicken, pan fried Asian chilli fish and king prawn Hunan style.The only dish that has disappointed me, not once but twice, was the Vietnamese clear soup which was very, very salty for a clear soup.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or30-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

Happy we were, because we didn't have had to wait much longer. But once we were in, we found that there were so many tables free. Still wondering why a false que was being created downstairs ?!The food, service n ambience was all great, once we were in. That has never been a doubt here.The starters were too many and too good.

1292,40,26 January 2016,"Good, but needs to do more as per Mainland China standards","As I have eaten at many of their restaurants including the one at Saki Naka, where I ate non-Indian Chinese food the best outside Tangda and Kamling at Churchgate, I have come to expect the same taste out of all of Mainland China's restaurants. Consistency, is after all, the crux of brand franchise which attracts customers.To be fair, it was not bad, just the fact that I have come to expect better of them. So, true to form I ordered the buffet which allows one to sample a large part of the menu. The starters were usual, but, here seemed to be tuned more to the Indian palate with a tilt on spices covering the flavour main item in the dish. The lollipop though popular in India, for me does not belong here. For one hand food does not belong in Chinese food and secondly, these were not as soft as they had ligaments in them which made them bad to chew. The rice and noodle had a little too much of salt. These two minor things made me miss the old Mainland China taste more. The crab, dish, again on account of the crabs being too small and thus messy made the experience a bit tiresome.Now, on the good side the soup, gravy dishes and starters apart from the above critique were good. The dessert selection was also good and the litchi margarita was especially great.Coming from me I would prefer them to stick to the taste they were known for because that is what made them and not catering to the general spicy Indian palate which I experienced in the Vashi outlet. Let's if things change :-) One more thing, as the place gets a good crowd it would be a good idea to call up and make reservation during peak lunch and dinner time.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or170-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

The different explosions of food on our taste buds can only be experienced as i fall short of words to describe this amazing experience. This restaurant gives the traditional combination of aloo bhindi a tasty transformation in the form of crispy potatoes and okra in chinese flavours (a must try). All kudos to the extremely courteous staff particularly Mr Abhay and Mr Sujit and of course the Chef who was very shy and slightly flustered in accepting our compliments.

The soup served was very salty, on pointing out the captain took it back, brought us new soup which was nice. He was apologetic about it.Starters were quite nice. They we ordered panfried noodles. While eating that there was a long strand of hair in the food stuck to a vegetable. I pointed it out to the manager again he was apologetic and took the dish back. He offered to bring me a replacement, at that stage I was in no mood of eating. The thought of quality of food being served was now under question. We were feeding my child as well from the same plate, that freaked us out more.The management offered to parcel me the same dish, I refused. The manger then came and said they will not charge me for the dish and please accept complimentary dessert.Well I appreciate the apologies and not charging for a dish WITH HAIR, serving me complimentary dessert - its still DOES NOT negate the fact that food from the chefs special menu is sent back to kitchen and a place with such a name in the culinary business has HAIR in the FOOD.We were thoroughly disappointed with this experience, this was specially not expected from MAINLAND CHINA , on my way out the manager said please come again I will serve you specially.To add this I hold a speciality preferred membership card - now I question it purpose",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or180-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

1309,40,21 July 2015,New Bombay's second-best Chinese restaurant,"You do a meal at Mainland China, and you realise why Anjan Chatterjee is a genius. He's got his formula down pat. You also see a great example of Bengali Chinese in action. (Nothing wrong with Bengalis or Bengali Chinese -- more later. I am a Bengali, BTW.)Mainland China does not serve pork or beef/ buff -- their non-veg offerings focus on the politically correct chicken, fish and prawn. They serve good prawn and fish. Their vegetarian offerings are decent, but the focus is on non-veg. They will have chilly chicken (here called General Tso's Chicken, IIRC) and a variety of fried rice including the Singapore Fried Rice which I never saw in Singapore.This is Bengali Chinese. For an alternate view of Indian Chinese restaurants, try Chung Fah of Pune Camp, or Ling's Pavilion near Regal Cinema, or The Bamboo restaurant in the Park, Belapur.The first Mainland China (in Bombay at least) used to be at Saki Naka, in Bombay. When it opened, the menu was innovative and really class-leading. Their stir-fried French beans were to die for. Some of that innovative approach has now gone out of the mainstream chain which Mainland China has now become. It's an extremely popular chain, because they deliver what most Chinese-food lovers in India want. Excellent decor and ambience, a somewhat up-market ""khandaani"" feel (lots of polished dark wood, for instance), very good service, a decent bar menu (necessary for those business dinners with clients). Together with this, the food is very well made, and has mild flavours, something which puts it in the upper bracket of Chinese restaurants. Unusual to see congee rice in most Indian Chinese restaurants, but these guys do it well. I treat Mainland China as comfort food -- excellent pan fried noodles with prawn, some chicken side dishes, some stir-fried vegetables, and a drink. Great fun. Very dependable.And their buffets are very popular and excellent value for money. Like Anjan Chatterjee's other restaurant (Sigree), this too does a top-notch, cost-effective buffet when you want to treat office colleagues or business associates and want to offer them a good lunch without having to think too much about the food.The best Chinese restaurant in New Bombay a decade ago used to be Yu Fan. It's now long dead. Today, the best is Bamboo in The Park, Belapur, but it too is suffering from low turnouts due to its location. Mainland China effortlessly sits as number two, in my view.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or180-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

1312,40,10 July 2015,Enjoy the Chineezzzz.....,Main land China is the place to enjoy tasty Chinese food. There is enough choice for Vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The starts are really delicious.

Though their fried noodles with honey and ice-cream and sizzling brownie with ice-cream are very good we skip dessert here to go downstairs and hog on fresh bengali sweets at Sweet Bengal.

The fresh fruit punches they served (i do not remember the names) was exotic. Vegetable in mahlak sauce was also tasty. Chicken fried rice was the only dish which can be rated as so-so.Our lunch ended up with a nice ice cream ,an another wonder. I am happy that even though they have several branches they have been able to maintain their quality.

With starters one can have wonderful cocktails.For main course try Burnt garlic rice with Hot and Sour fish, Chicken Manchurian and Crispy lamb.Do not forget the table before visiting or else you could return disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or240-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

1367,20,25 June 2014,Daylight robbery,"Its terrible value for money. At 750 per person for a meal its just not worth it. We ordered 8 island soup, chicken satay, pan fried noodles, honey lemon chicken and garlic fried rice. Unfortunately the complementary kimchi in the beginning was the best part. The soup was worse than Maggi powdered soup. Tasteless. The satay was again flavorless. The pan fried noodles cold and stale tasting. The lemon chicken was as sweet as toffee. Overall I felt its totally overpriced and no authentic experience at all. The staff was in a hurry to serve us possibly pre prepared food.

Item by item experience is narrated here. All items are vegetarian1) Vegetable Coriander Siu Mai Dimsums - Lovely, Great stuff with the mustard and pepper sauce- Starter ( This writer with the help of google and wikipedia understands that this dimsum was introduced during Quing dynasty.Today it is considered as part of cantonese cuisine.It is a single filling dimsum, and in today's case it was finely chopped vegetables)2) Vegetable fried wontons - Too much oil and too little filling - disappointing - The shape was interesting - starter3) Lemon chilly potato - Average - starter ( There was no lemon flavour)4) Stir fried vegetables - Very good stuff - starter5) Vegetable hot and sour soup - some people may like it - Overall taste is bland6)Onion garlic fried rice - main course - very good . Great texture and well cooked7) Veg Hakka noodles - main course - good for noodle lovers - I was expecting a smoky flavour, but it was missing- unfortunately this writer is not a noodle lover8)Mixed vegetable szechuan(sichuan ) sauce - The souce originated from sichuan province in south western china. It has a bold and spicy flavour due to the use of garlic and chilly peppers. Wonderful taste and goes well with all vegetables.9)Haricot beans with dry red chillies and sesame - Surprisingly it was made out of a green bean with pod and not dried bean - Interesting dish, but tastes only above average10) Vegetable dumplings in soya garlic sauce - Lovely stuff - spicy and an Indian palate will love it11)Seasonal vegetable in ginger wine sauce - This preparation in white sauce in bland and creamy.some may like it12) Various deserts13 ) Copious supply of jasmine tea - Wonderful beverage , goes well with the mealOverall food quality great.

Maybe some would consider this not to be authentic Chinese and may say that it is Indianized Chinese food. Maybe, but if you are not bothered about tags and want to have excellent food in a very good ambiance, this is the place. And very good service too.They serve Jasmine green tea on the house right from the beginning - only problem is that it is always lukewarm - never hot.They have valet parking - that is a good thing, as it may be quite crowded during peak times. They accept reservations over phone. If you do not have a reservation, you may end up waiting for 1/2 to 1 hour or even more during peak times.I personally liked the Almond rice cooked and wrapped in lotus leaves",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or260-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

I loved the starters here, especially the pepper chicken and the money bag they serve. Don't expect any surprises with the main menu. I felt it is quite average. The lack of variety in the buffet menu is something which saddened me. I couldn't find much changes in the menu during my visit here. But it is a great value for money buffet i feel. for 525 Rs, you can get good Chinese starters+avg main course+good deserts. The buffet sounds to be the most affordable option here as the other items in the menu are bit costly. There is a bar available which has a good selection of drinks as well.

The dimsums are a delight, the lemon coriander soup lightens you up in anticipation of the main course which has great options too. Also the buffet is definitely value for money.

1413,30,15 October 2012,Pretty ordinary,"The mainland china a la carte menu was stiflingly expensive and the taste of the rice dishes were not eto my liking. They were too bland and one had to literally search for the chicken/or prawn in the rice. Dissapointing experience. Add to it the service tax/Vat/ and a Service charge ? They want you to pay 10% of the bill to bring the food on the table and give you a smile. I had decided not to go to the place when a friend of mine recommended the weekday lunch buffet. Now that was a good one. It was real value at Rs 450/- (no extra service charges!!). They were thoughtfull enough to put half charge on my son who is 11 years, withou even asking for it. It was a good gesture. Looks like they have changed for the better. I shall definitely recommend the lunch buffet. Not the a la carte with the 10%service charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or290-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai
1414,20,17 September 2012,"Poor food, indifferent sevice","Extremely average, by the chain's standards (which itself are falling - more on that later). This one is not particularly helped by poor service. The food itself was indifferent. Went late, after the office lunch crowds were leaving. This outlet, relatively new, has come up at a location where clearly it is hard to find good staff. The building and surrounding areas also look like they would remain under construction for a while.I am beginning to wonder if the Mainland China group is expanding a bit fast. Having eaten at various outlets in different cities over the years, I am beginning to find that the food is extremely inconsistent, from day to day (at the same outlet), and from city to city. In their aggressive move to expand, they seem to have sacrificed quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g1532344-d3194542-Reviews-or290-Mainland_China-Navi_Mumbai_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Vashi, Navi Mumbai

Although the decor looks and feels premium, my personal opinion is that the quality & taste of the food served has really dropped from their previous high standards.

We opted for their buffet. As usual, the soup and starters (five types) were served at the table. They were all very good. The buffet spread had enough options. To our dismay, we found that the non-vegetarian preparations were mostly very spicy – perhaps to accommodate local preferences. The vegetarian dishes, thankfully, were more traditionally Chinese – the kind of preparations for which Mainland China made its name. The dessert section was a disappointment with fewer choices. Some options were exhausted and replenishments were not forthcoming, while a few –pineapple turnover (?) – were even stale.

1431,50,18 October 2019,Great Chinese cuisine,"I have visited Mainland China Restaurant in the past, however, it was a visit to their flagship restaurant on Gurusaday Dutta Road. This was the first time I visited their South City Mall branch following ‘strong’ recommendations(read ‘demand’) from my two nieces.We had a meal for 5 persons, and the bill was around INR5000 without any drinks. This is no means an inexpensive place to dine, and I walked in knowing that fully well.You could either try their buffet, which is a very good spread. However, I would recommend that you actually take a stroll with your plate to select your favourites, and not to depend on the ‘helpful’ waiters serving a huge portion of chicken drumstick to fill you up. The a la carte choice are good, and you get descent portions of authentic Cantonese and Schezwan dishes. If you are not a big eater, then you could easily share a large portion of one dish between two people if you would like to.Overall, a fine dining experience. If you are not bothered about how much you are paying, then it is a fantastic treat for you and your family or friends.

Upon reaching the table he apologized for the delay and that I had to wait.All the waiters were very well-behaved too. Starters were served at the table fornour convenience.About the food, they have a widespread buffet on a regular basis too. Their a-la-carte menu is vast too!

1457,30,24 September 2018,Chinese food,I have been a regular to Mainland China south city mall and always enjoyed the food over there. I am a veg person so i love that they have separate kitchen and utensils for veggies. But this was the first time I found the quality of the food not upto the mark. Pan fried noodles were not properly cooked and spring rolls were very oily. This is a premium eating place amd I expect them to maintain their quality. Though the staff are very helpful and ambience is worth enjoying,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d3863637-Reviews-or30-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Jodhpur Park, Kolkata

1461,20,2 June 2018,"Mainland China, indiranagar, Bangalore",Found Mainland China to be very expensive and not worth it!Quantity of rice was very less for a large portion which would not suffice even for 2 people.

1463,30,19 May 2018,Revisited after reopening post refurbishment,"Wanted to revisit this authentic Chinese Restaurant at 3rd floor of South City Mall. The restaurant reopened almost after a year, closed due to South City renovation. As soon as I stepped in, the ambience made me feel happy. Wood panels with Oriental styled designs and red upholstered seating bring flavour to the overall decor. They offer a well spread Buffet at Rs. 949 plus tax (on weekdays lunch Rs. 849 plus tax ). I dislike buffet and hence went for usual a la carte. While ordering, the first DISAPPOINTMENT WAS NON AVAULABILITY OF DUCK OR LAMB. Not expected in a high end restaurant. Can't help. So disgruntled and disappointed, our only option was chicken or prawn. We decided to stick to chicken and started with Thai style chicken dumplings(Rs. 310 for 4 pieces and Rs 38t gor 4 pieces.) Dumplings were soft with a touch of light tangy soya based broth. Little pricy compared to the portion for sure. In main course, we chose Wok tossed veg hakka noodles(Rs. 435) and Chicken with assorted pepper(Rs. 545). Noodles was good in taste but the dish was spoilt with slightly excess salt. Bad job from the chef. I didn't raise this in restaurant since I hate receiving favor in lieu in terms of non charging the item or heavy discount. I prefered to raise this in my review. But the chicken was well prepared. Overall experience was below par. Hope I get a better preaparatipn next time including getting all my choices as listed in the menu.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d3863637-Reviews-or40-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Jodhpur Park, Kolkata

Their buffet spread for the weekend has plenty of options including 2 non-veg starters, 1 non-veg soup and 4 non-veg mains including crab.

1467,40,20 February 2018,Specialist Chinese cuisine,"In Calcutta if you are looking for a place to have specialist Chinese cuisine then I suggest this place. Although this might not be the only place in Calcutta but this definitely scores a better as compared with others in terms of its variety of dishes to offer, it's ambiance, the behavior of the chef's and staff.Though am not a great sushi fan, but post having the same here and being explained about it by the chef himself I can say its indeed one of the dish not to be missed as you visit.Apart from the sushi, they have very unique preparation of crabs, fishes, chicken indeed lip smacking. What more they have a separate cuisines listed for Jain vegetarians, so if u are a vegan or love to eat non veg this place is a must try.We celebrated our anniversary dinner here and would like to keep visiting again in order to rake up our taste buds in future as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d3863637-Reviews-or40-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Jodhpur Park, Kolkata

We started with assorted dimsums and basil flavored chicken dumplings. In main course we selected wok tossed hunan style chicken, my all time favorite roasted duck with plum sauce, ginger capsicum fried rice and wok tossed Hakka noodles. The dimsums and dumplings were perfectly cooked with required softness and juiciness. Chicken and duck was perfectly tasty with measured tanginess and flavor.

I am sure that the alcoholic beverage section was great too, maybe some other reviewer will vouch for that. For the starters, I had the assorted non vegeterian dim sum platter with the mouth watering sauces. In a nutshell, it brings you the taste of the best in dim sums in their collection.The main course started with wok tossed hakka prawn noodles along with sizzling chicken with barbecued onions. Then came the star of the show, the roast lamb in mahlok sauce. It was heavenly and I would like to have it again and again.Although I wish I could savour the deserts, but I was full, and hence I asked the waiter for the bill.

The place was very crowded and we had to wait about 30 mins for a table. But when we go the table the service was really bad. Intervals between starters were 15 mins. We finished one and had to wait quite some time the second one to arrive. At last we got frustrated and grabbed what ever was there on the buffet. The fish was finished and so were the veterinarian starters. One of the guys with us was a vegetarian on that day due to religious considerations, he practically was not able to eat anything. Veggie options were terrible. Non veg options were also the same old bland stuff. Nothing exciting or new taste.

Having tried their buffet in their Ballygunj establishment, this time decided to try the a-la-carte. That was a very bad decision. Though the quality of food was definitely better than buffet, the price point was really high. I would not recommend for 2 person to go for a-la-carte. A least 3 person group is recommended for a-la-carte as the portion are good for 3 , even 4, and through sharing the variety o dishes can be explored. The food though was good and service excellent. The Chicken Corn soup was a bit less hot than expected, otherwise was a good lunch, though not excellent, and we paid a premium considering 2 person only.

1544,40,14 June 2015,Keeping the Faith,"Kolkata has an old and tasty history with Chinese food. From the mysterious and amazing restaurants in Tangra’s Chinatown to the breakfast mouthfuls in Teriti Bazar, there is always time in the city for some noodles and momos or dumplings. For every family in the sprawling metropolis, one of the first choices for eating out has to be Chinese. So it’s not surprising that the best restaurant serving Chinese in Kolkata has to be Mainland ChinaThe first thing that strikes you as you are ushered in by the hostess at the entrance is this beautifully designed restaurant that is full, noisy with loud music and smiling waiters who are eager to please. Food is everywhere and the smell of Chinese flavours mesmerises you even before you sit down. True to its nature as a chaotic busy eating place, it fits in well with the overall reputation that Mainland China has in this city.But a reputation for good food extends only to the next dish that is served to the customers. We ordered Crabmeat soup with egg drop and chillies, salt and pepper prawns, Wok-tossed hakka noodles and shredded chicken in black pepper sauce, washed down with chilled beer and virgin Pina Colada. The service was prompt. The soup came within minutes of ordering followed soon after by the salt and pepper prawns. The main course took some time, thankfully. It was a Sunday and the waiters and managers had one eye on the long line of customers waiting outside and the clock. Nevertheless, the soup and the appetiser were delicious and served hot. The main course of hakka noodles and shredded chicken was much appreciated too.The ambience, the service and the food combined to give Mainland China a wonderful place to eat Chinese food served in impeccable style. Even though they tried their best to rush us into finishing our food like Usain Bolt on a 100-metre dash, there is no denying that it was an afternoon well spent on the Chinese Mainland",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d3863637-Reviews-or120-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Jodhpur Park, Kolkata

Dumplings which were not tasty and another chicken dish which i gladly want to forget. It seems the staff and the restaurant management have started to rest on their laurels or on the outlet's name and have completely lost the zeal to serve good Chinese food and more importantly most of them looked bored and looked as if they were doing u a favor by serving you.The warmth and the kind hospitality was missing and so was the menu on the buffet platter which lacked imagination and taste. Fish in mustard and mango sauce was repulsing in taste and so was a crab dish. Most of the other dishes tasted bland and dull.

A fav of all of us. Being a weekday night there was not much rush and we were ushered to our table calmly.Among us one was pure vegetarian who get totally obnoxious with the sight of non vegetarian. But we 2 are totally hardcore non veg.Anyway our dinner started with the drinks and starter of chicken. The chicken was very spicy and we were liking it. Our veg friend loves the aroma of the chillies. But we were helpless as he couldn't eat the chicken. But the guys from Mainland China made it memorable by making the same dish for our Veg friend with the mushrooms. He was very happy and we are happy for him.Kudos to Mainland China.Since our starter was spicy and I was sweating a lot, they serve us cold towels. It was really refreshing and a thoughtful gesture from them.They suggest us regarding our main course by balancing the heat.Really they give us a personalized service and this touch made a memorable dinner for 3 of us.Thanks Mainland China for making it for us.Dr. Soodit Pal.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d3863637-Reviews-or140-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Jodhpur Park, Kolkata

Had to go inside at 7.05pm and ask if it is ok to come in and if they were open to take customers in.Food good quality no doubt so well done to the chef. Our server (Pankaj) also did well.

We had the fried and steamed momo along with few alcoholic beverages after a hectic shopping spree in the mall. The hot starters was like a rejuvenate feeling for us. Even though it was the day of Durga Puja with the waiting list for their guest running in huge numbers, the way they coordinated the whole thing, handled the crowd with smiling face and immense patient shows how much they care about their guest. While the guest where waiting for their tables, we where all served with cold drinks which I thought was a very kind gesture from the restaurant since some of us late comers had a 20-25 mins wait to get a table due to the huge crowd.The huge crowd waiting for tables that day speaks a lot about the huge demand that this restaurant has embedded in the hearts of people in Kolkata.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d3863637-Reviews-or170-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Jodhpur Park, Kolkata

1593,40,29 September 2013,Really eclectic regional Chinese dishes,"We ended up having mainly starters. The quality of the dimsums at Mainland China has really reached a level of excellence rivaling any 5 star Chinese. I ordered my favourite, the corn and water chestnut, crab cakes and the prawn hargao, all excellent and really very reasonably priced for the level of skill involved. What I admire is the creativity with the vegetarian appetisers - lettuce wrapped with water chestnuts, corn and mushroom; the all time favourite crackling spinach and the other all time Mainland China special, crispy corn pepper. This time we also tried the chicken Hunan style - the Mainland China take on chilli chicken but made with chilli oil, ginger and soya as opposed to the usual thick chilli sauce. Also try the black pepper jumbo prawns. This particular sauce made with coarsely crushed pepper, garlic and oyster sauce is one of my all time favorites of the restaurant. A new dish we tried is stir fried lamb with cumin which has a 'distinctive Indianess' to it but is apparently from Kunming in China. I like the light stir fry technique, without sauce. The squid butter garlic has now become fish butter garlic which is an improvement on the old dish.What I have always loved about Mainland China is whether you want a more traditional take on Chinese (don't we all hanker for a sweet corn chicken or a hot and sour at sometime?) or really eclectic regional Chinese dishes, you will find them both in this restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d3863637-Reviews-or170-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Jodhpur Park, Kolkata

I was there for a lunch buffet with a party of 11. They gave us seats at the backside next to the kitchen door. In a few minutes it started smelling like an unclean bathroom. I dismissed it considering the good experience I had in the past. At the end of our lunch, the others around me also mentioned the same thing. I called the manager to complain and all he said is Sorry, we will take care of it. When I asked about what they are going to do about my bad experience, he really had nothing to say. He could have offered a discount or compensate in some other way.

Starters were served at the table fornour convenience.About the food, they have a widespread buffet on a regular basis too. Their a-la-carte menu is vast too!

One issue which bothers me (not only related to this branch) at all Mainland China restaurants and their group restaurants all across India (I have dined in 8 restaurants at 5 cities in India, several times) is that they do not want to accept American Express Card citing that machine is not working or there is some issue with the American Express line. The tag line is same all across India, which suggests that this is a top management instruction not to accept Amex card unless the guest objects seriously or do not have any other card. Since, I did not want to ruin my experience, I never objected and gave alternative card. As a result in around 15 visits in the last 4 years I have never been able to swipe my Amex card in any of the group restaurants ( Mainland China, SIgree, Oh Calcutta or Machan).

To resolve the mystery behind Chinese cuisine 'Mainland China' is the place.It's a lifetime experience to have a Chinese cuisine in Mainland China, whether it's in Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi or Goa. If the dishes are compared with mainland China then one can't call it authentic Chinese dishes, but the quality of food is awesome. It suits the taste bud of Indians but when I took some Chinese friends they appreciated.One can feel the flavours, textures and the aroma intermingle and form the perfect blend of heavenly taste. Sauces, ingredients, and spices are handpicked from provinces such as Guangdong, Hunan and fresh markets of Beijing, after which masterchefs scour for original recipes and new methods to add more to the meal.Masterchefs are extraordinary, foods are awesome, ambience is wonderful and service is beyond expectation. As a whole, it's an experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or30-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

1655,20,1 June 2018,SHOCKING,"Yesterday night , at my 33rd MARRIAGE ANNIVERSARY, to give a special treat to my wife, I went to well hyped MAINLAND CHINA, located at Gurusaday Dutta Road, Kolkata for the first time for A La Carte dinner, expecting good service, special treatment (as I already informed them about the occasion as asked by them over phone at the time of reservation), good food quality worthy for price. I ordered (as suggested the service boy as I was first time goer and not convenient with the name of food at all) Vietnamese Noodles Clear Soup Chicken Portion, Jambo Prawns, Panfrd Noodles with topping of your choice prawn, Freshwater Bekti in sauce of choice regular, Mango Pudding. To my horror experience, Noodles, the main food, was prepared with thin and tasteless noodle (easily available in the market) topping with pile of huge cauliflower pieces, pumpkin pieces , huge cabbages and many mushrooms , some big chicken pieces (which, I am sure, boiled, chopped very casually and separately added after preparation the item) with rare view of shrimp, lamb pieces and others. The soup was tasteless with an unusual flavour not soothing and thick and long noodles, spinach and some pieces of chicken chopped very casually. The taste of Bekti was not at all special and to be very frank, the no. of pieces were not at all worthy of price. Service Boy was casual. I am really sorry for highlighting my experience with one of the Kolkata famous dinning restaurants but I am more sorry for choosing wrong restaurant at one of the auspicious occasions in my life.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or50-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

Another change....they are selling black bean sauce and black pepper sauce and a host of desserts in their ground floor waiting room. Would have given five stars but the cheese cake and Apple tart for dessert were disappointing. They should just stick to darsan and ice creams for dessert and increase their appetizers.

I would suggest you request the concierge at the hotel to book a table or be prepared for at least 15/30minutes wait. There are two of branches in Kolkata, I prefer going to the one at Ballygunj, the original one. This time it was their 25th Anniversary and their hospitality which is always excellent, was a notch higher. The food as usual was excellent. I will not suggest any specific dishes but consider leaving this hard work of choosing the right ones for yourself to the waiters. Of course, after giving them your taste parameters and the no-no’s. That is for example, no very spicy or hot dishes. I am sure you will be rewarded, as I have been, almost always. Excellent as always overall and wish them many more anniversaries.

Good ambiance. Great staff. The only issue is that you may need to be careful during rush hour (Lunch/Dinner) as you may end up on the ""wait list"", waiting for your chance to dine, due to the rush.

1692,50,9 July 2017,If you are feeling happy .. Mainland China it is !!,"One of the most unique aspects about visiting Mainland China is the ""Feeling of Happiness"" which is subtly associated with it !An outstanding variety of options - Our family of three have huge debates on what to choose ! Invariably we settle for the Prawns Sui Mui (Dimsums) , Chicken Wanton Soup , Fragrant pot rice and General Tau's chicken. A meal for three is around Rs 1800 and leaves you totally satiated !!My strong recommendation for those who have not yet tried out the Sui Mui (Dimsums) try it out !! The Prawn sui mui just melts in your mouth and the chicken sui mui are just delicious too ...I must admit - That it is worth every effort - Both the wait and the drive if you have to.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or90-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

1698,50,17 May 2017,A-LA-CARTE at its Best,"Our anniversary was on May 07; we decided that spending 28 years together calls for a sumptuous dinner at Mainland China, Gurusaday Road – the place we went in when they started about 20 years ago.My usual choice at Mainland China is their well spread buffet, but this time around, wife and son decided against; so I had to go along and agree to taste from the A-La-Carte menu – I must tell you that at the end of the meal, I have had no regrets for falling in line.The assorted DimSums (chicken, prawn and crab cakes, alongwith delicious mustard and black pepper sauce) was superb – rightly steamed and served well. This was followed by the out-of-the world Fresh water Bekti in a light sauce – large portion of 12 reasonable sized Becktis, honey sauce oozing from the sides – made for a great appetizer! (In fact, I was full by this time round). Beer to accompany for the 2 of us and a chilled glass of Lime, Lychee and Gondhoraj Lime for my son – we tasted this concoction – I can surely say that such drinks far outweigh the usuals.The main course included Roast Chicken Fried Rice, Vegetable Hakka Noodles (suggested by the person serving – his logic – too many non veg dishes ordered – for balance, we needed a Veggy food – and he was right) with a large helping of Roast Lamb in pepper sauce all presented properly and tasted even better.What a better way to end such a lovely dinner than to have a helping of Honey Glazed Noodles and a scoop of vanilla ice cream!The pricing is above average at Rs 4,000 for the dinner, but sometimes pricing needs to be sheltered in the tasteThanks Mainland China for such a memorable Dinner!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or90-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

1700,50,8 May 2017,FINE DINING CHINESE RESTAURANT,Mainland China has two outlets - one on Gurusaday Road and the other in South City Mall. I have always been to the South City one as this is very close to my house.First the decor - simply WOW !!! for a fine dining experience and the staff right from the Guy who is at the front desk - all so courteous with a warm smile. What I really like is that the restaurant is simply nice and quiet as in some fine dining restaurants in Kolkata the Customers are just so loudNow comes the food - very well taken care off - even if you have a pure vegetarian guest with you they ensure that the tableware is different for easy identification and there is no mess. I have been here for the 4th time with my son and a vegetarian friend - so we ordered Lemon Coriander soup - one was vegetarian for my friend ; two with chicken (for me and my son as we are non-vegetarian) - Oh God it was just awesome - it was a perfect blend of spice and aroma. We then ordered Sui mai (vegetarian and chicken) - am lost for words and then for the main course it was Veg noodle; Non veg fried rice; Mushroom n Brocolli vegetable ; Steamed chicken with Mushroom and believe me each and every cuisine was OHHHHHH AWESOME. We ended with a fancy Dessert - Ice-cream with Ranbutan - its pointless describing it in words - so would suggest if you go please have this,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or100-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

1708,10,9 February 2017,Definitely not worth the money,"Visited the Gurusaday Road outlet in Kolkata a month back and I was totally disappointed.The food was way too oily and spicy. Oil seeped out of the dishes like that of a cheap outlet. We went for the buffet lunch and the number and variety of dishes was limited. Three of the starters were part of the main course, just unbelievable. The main course itself was a small spread for a buffet.The desserts were a sorry affair with a bland almost salty custard and a stone-frozen icecream (more like rock-ice).The waiter asked for our feedback and I pointed out the oily nature of food. Their lead-chef came to me and started arguing about my feedback.The worst part, they messed up the billing and told me to pay an additional 500 bucks. They kept on arguing and after about 20 minutes only after I sternly asked to speak to a manager did they relent and cleared up their act.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or100-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

1716,30,26 December 2016,Not As Good As they Used To Be,This restaurant started off as Chinese food buffet at an affordable price. Hence the popularity and crowd.What I totally dislike is it isn't possible to book a table in advance and they use monosodium glutamate in their cooking. It is strange because this is a controversial ingredient and used only in street foods in oriental countries. Not something expected in a considerable food restaurant.Some of my guests from Taiwan refused to eat here after knowing the they use monosodium glutamate in their cooking.Not sure why a good chef would want to use artificial taste and flavour enhancer in their cooking.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or110-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

1719,10,16 December 2016,End of the road for MLC,"Dear Mr. ChatterjeeNot sure if this note will reach you but I truly hope it does, as this is coming from someone who has been having food from MLC for the past 13 years and has had food from various outlets across the country, and has been a big fan of MLC food.I have had the privilege of being a regular at your restaurant at Saki Naka till I was in Mumbai and was known personally to your senior staff. For the past 4 years, I have been a regular at your restaurant at Pune Amanora outlet and am well recognised there as well. I have not just been a great fan of the food that's dolled out from the kitchens of MLC but am also a foodie and know the taste of each dish in its entirety, so much so that I can tell the difference even when there is a slightest change to the taste.I am deeply saddened to say that my last couple of visits to your outlet in Amanora (Pune) have been a serious let down, so much so that I have confronted your staff and they have admitted that the main Chef has been on leave or wasn't the one behind the wok that particular evening. The junior chefs just don't have the same touch - The taste, consistency, texture has undergone a change.Being an ardent fan of MLC, I thought its my duty to let you know of the experience, as I have suddenly lost faith in the USP of MLC, which is the ability to serve great tasting food, with perfect consistency, irrespective of the outlet, each time. I hope this note reaches you and not just your senior staff or customer service team, who may choose to ignore this feedback. The reputation of MLC is at stake here...If a customer from 13 years who frequents the restaurant 2-3 times a month can lose faith, it won't be long before others follow suit.

When we arrived at the location the reservation was not there and we had to wait for 35 min . It was very annoying for us .The food was great - no doubt , that's why we choose to eat there .Even upon departing we filled up the customer service form and mentioned the problem .

1901,50,2 February 2015,Same great quality,This restaurant has been a favourite of ours ever since it opened its doors in the 1990s. It started off as a great place for authentic Chinese food within the city without having to go to Taj Bengal or to Tangra. We were visiting after a long break and were a bit wary about changes that might have reduced the authenticity of the dishes or the standards of service. All the apprehensions vanished since the restaurant provided the same authentic food and impeccable service as always. The food was as authentic as one can get - the service was great and when they got one of the dishes wrong they promptly rectified it without a single word.

1902,40,2 February 2015,Very good food and lots of variety,"I visited this restaurant in Dec'14 with my family and my friends family. It was a great experience. The restaurant has a very big spread. We choose to have the buffet which came with the complementary drinks (either 1 beer or 1 fruit juice) along with 3 types of veg and 5 types of non-veg starters. The main course consists of mainly Chinese and some Indian dishes. There are 3-4 varieties of rice item and nearly as many poultry. You'll also find lamb, crab and mutton items. The desert was rather disappointing considering the options for the other courses. Desert was ice-cream, fruit salad and some pastry/cakes. That's about it. It seems that the journey was going on very well from the start but finished abruptly. One possible reason could be that we reached for the desert table around 3pm and maybe all of it was over by then and not refilled.Nevertheless, the taste of the food (both starters and main course) was excellent. They also serve alcohol here however we didn't go that far being with our families.Overall a good luncheon and worth every rupee spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or310-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

1911,40,2 January 2015,Good Buffet,"Mainland China is a well-known name in Kolkata, where the restaurant has a presence not only off Gurusaday Datta Road but also in South City Mall and on the E.M. Byepass. We usually patronize the one in South City Mall because of its convenient location and added advantage of shopping cum feasting. However, the restaurant off Gurusaday Datta Road is also excellent and has good parking facilities. We had to wait a few minutes before they could seat us. Seating area is nice and comfortable...I guess they cannot do anything about screaming kids. Screaming kids are a menace anywhere!The buffet on the day we visited had crab, lamb, fish and prawns ...what's not to like? The soup and starters were served to us and excellent assortment of fish, chicken and dimsums. I must admit though, I have had better dimsums elsewhere...which is surprising because usually their dimsums are very nice and I can make a meal of that. The soup had generous helpings of diced chicken...so no complaint there.The buffet offered a range of choice but the Chinese fried rice they serve here is not like the one I have had in my chilldood...the aroma is missing although the taste is good in its own way. The prawns were mild and got my vote for the best item. Other items were well cooked too but I find that most of their gravies use a lot of corn starch which I do not much like.Desserts on offer did not live up to the variety and quality of the starters and main items...the thin slices of cake/pastry were dry; icecream had ice particles. Cut fruit is something I avoid outside the house, irrespective of how good the restaurant so I passed it by.They have a reasonably clean toilet but you may have to queue up.In all, GREAT buffet and good starters. Now if only they would leave the tipping to us instead of adding it to the bill...a practice many restaurants have started. It means waiters have no incentive and I am forced to tip inadequate service as well as excellent service at the same rate...not fair I think for the good worker.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or320-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

1913,40,31 December 2014,Great Chinese Food,Mainland China lives up to the reputation of being one of the best Chinese restaurant in the town. Had a dinner session with friends on the 29th and opted for the buffet. The starters were excellent and so was the food.

If you are unlucky, like my wife and self on weekend evenings, they make you seat at a lousy place near the stairs.People mostly come for the buffet spread which is reasonably priced.We normally order a la carte as I have diet restriction.We are therefore served unlimited green tea which is refreshing.Kimchi and marinated cucumber and carrot is also on the house.There is good but limited choice of dishes and soups. You will not be disappointed although they could cut down on oil.The service is quite good and you do not mind the service charges added in the bill.Mainland China is a justifiably very popular eating joint and has a loyal clientle.People like us are members of their loyalty club which is valid for their other signature restaurants like Oh Calcutta.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or330-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

The menu is quite predictable but also delicious as always. The chicken starter, which were essentially lollipops in a dark sauce was a hit.Out of the menu, I find General Tao's favourite chicken, sliced lamb in Mahalak sauce, the shrimps in XO sauce to be the specialities. However, I find the vegetarian fare to be quite average.I have been to Mainland China outlets in Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, three in Kolkata and I find the Kolkata Gurusaday Road to be quite consistent in quality and taste.The service is good everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or330-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

1934,20,30 October 2014,Service is definitely on a southbound path,I have been an avid patron of the chain since it;s inception and have been to the different venues at multiple cities .It had always been delightful to visit along with my spouse and daughters in Kolkata and Mumbai or other places in India where I travel . In the first week of October seven of us had visited the Gurusaday Road outlet and unfortunately did not enjoy at all . First of all I had requested during booking that we will have ala carte and would like to sit as far as available from the buffet . To our chagrin we were placed right next to the buffet and were almost cajoled not to go for ala carte . However on insisting that I have been a Speciality Preferred member for many years the steward finally gave in but told us curtly that the seating arrangement could not be changed . After ordering the starters there was a considerable delay and when we asked for the reason we were curtly told that we should have gone for the buffet . The same followed for the main course and by this time I was seriously thinking of getting out as fast as possible . But the icing on the cake was that when we were having our dessert of Darshan with Ice Cream we are told to finish fast as there were people waiting .I am sorry to state that this will probably be my last visit to this MC outlet as such kind of pompousness and arrogance is the last thing that you want when you go out to have a good time . I hope the message goes to the top management that after establishing a brand you just cannot just fritter it away because of a few untrained individulas who have no nuances for service !,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or340-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

1936,30,18 October 2014,Expansion sans maintaining quality,"I have been a patron of this restaurant and the group which owns it since the days they started in Bombay with a restaurant with about 4 tables called Only Fish! Since that little hole in the wall they started Mainland in Bombay and now taken it all over the Country and some places in the World, of course they have other chains in their stable as well, like Oh! Calcutta, Sigree and the budget Chinese Hakka amongst others...MC has been a favourite of mine for years and I have seen some of the Managers grow with the chain, from being Maitre d'Hotels to Regional heads for the chain. They have been extremely kind hosts for many a special occasion in my life and the hospitality they used to provide was their hallmark. I do thank them for that.What saddens me is the downhill path the chain has succumbed to..... the quality of food has suffered, the service levels are shoddy, the ambience of the restaurant has deteriorated and no one seems to be bothered about that. Dishes which have been their hallmark since the last 14 years or so have left my taste buds in shambles to say the least. A restaurant which I have used in many an occasion to entertain business associates is no longer a place one can do so, its noisy, cluttered and the service levels are just appalling.I may have been a tad harsh as this place was close to my heart, but I do sincerely hope that they buckle up and stop taking their patrons for granted.... or more importantly ruin the experience the founder so emphatically sold to one and all when he started the chain.Its expensive to boot, so for the price one pays today there are a better places where one can tickle their taste buds!This particular outlets (Gurusaday road) has tumbled further with the Restaurant Manager being moved to another outlet...",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or340-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

There is an amazing collection of beers and my friend chose Hoe Garden beer for both of us which I found to be very good.The Chicken Correander soup followed and starters of excellent varieties of tastes, both veg and non veg were served on the table.They were all great but the preparations of fish were by far the best.It took me quite a while to make out what the preparation was made from.Non veg had fish, chicken,crab, lamb and veg starters had mushroom, baby corn, potatoes etc.After all this, going into the main course was nothing short of an adventure.You had two types of noodles, fried rice and steamed rice as main course to go with wonderful preparations of prawn, chicken, crab and mutton preparations.Your mind wants to repeat all of them all over but physically you are not able to do so any more.The desserts as usual start with excellent darsan with ice cream of your choice and chef's special preparations of cakes.Overall, it was excellent value for money with lunch costing about 800/- without drinks, which of course is separately chargeable.It is a good deal any day:-)",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or410-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

One can get such food in much cheaper restaurants especially in Kolkata which is well-known for a particular gharana of so-called Chinese food except that the food is served by English speaking staff and on excellent crockery.Such up-class joints are expected to do something different such as, offering “Ethnic Chinese” fare served in real Chinese style which is usually not available outside China.

2022,20,30 September 2013,Very disappointing,"I must say that I wasn't expecting this from the buffet on 5th September at the Mainland China. Since it was Teachers Day, we decided to go for lunch. We being teachers and being Teachers Day, we had expected something special but alas! The spread was large but the quality average except for the di sum which was great! Before booking I tried getting in touch with Mr Debashish Ghosh in vain. Innumerable phone calls hit a wall and this is NOT the first time that he has evaded taking calls and no call is returned despite requests. Absolutely shocking as this was not the case in the first few years. The waiting was poor . The waitors are no longer of the same that was earlier. The crabs served were so tiny that it was impossible to have them. We need quality food and not quantity alone! Please wake up and this is all the more required in the face of stiff competition! To be honest, I doubt whether the buffet would ever be a preferred choice for me at Mainland China!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or430-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

2024,40,15 September 2013,Not value for money but worth the experience,"I go here quite regularly since its close to my house.However the quality has deteriorated somewhat from what it used to be.Earlier the buffet used to be delicious, now the food, though good, is often cold and feels much heavier on the stomach not to mention that it often gets crowded and noisy during the lunch buffet.Though a la carte is a better option, or becomes extremely expensive if you are a heavy eater like me.All in all, not a restaurant to miss out on if you're in the city and want the taste of some authentic Indian Chinese but it will burn a hole in your pocket.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or430-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

In my opinion, food tastes great there but the taste has strong indian influence to please the bigger mass. But in Mainland China the chinese is not that much Indianised.

2030,30,8 August 2013,"Great buffet lunch, but a bit too much corn starch?","This was one of those repeat visits to Mainland China – every time we visit Kolkata we have to just do a meal at MC. It's one of those things you just do. Not even knowing why, because family, friends, and every one's uncle does it.We always seem to be doing the buffet lunch, and this time around we enjoyed the great Five eats for Four offer which made it even more appetising (the deal, that is). The spread as always is huge - with a good range of both vegetarian and non-veg starters, a good selection of mains including veg dishes, fish, prawns, mutton and chicken dishes to select from. The starters are interesting - with a fair round of dim sum, and the chicken drums being just one of those can't stop at one thingies. Soup and starters were served at the table.The mains were nothing out of the ordinary – but I'm guessing demanding incredible at a buffet is asking for a bit too much. The chilli fish was the only dish that I went back for. Every other main serving on offer seemed boring, and way too much like any other buffet dish in any other wannabe chinese restaurant .Dessert had ice cream, fritters you have with vanilla, fruit and more. But there's hardly ever room for sweeties after you've done the main course rounds over again.The live cooking station that stirs up some quick veggies is outstanding, but we (as in the folks visiting Kolkata) found the food a whole different kind of 'chinese'. It's neither szechuan, nor cantonese, not hong kong, and not north american chinatown. It's ""Indian Chinese done Calcutta style"" with healthy doses of what seemed like corn starch. Real ""chinese"" food is usually light and flavourful and each dish is unique. Not this time at MC. Not at the buffet.Mind you, I always like going to MC. Kind of look forward to it every time I visit the city, but this time, I just couldn't enjoy the lunch. Too much of something that was common across every dish that made it somewhat glutinous and overly, quickly, filling. Here's a caveat: it's perhaps just us ""probashis"" (expats) who felt this way. Our hosts seemed to be enjoying from soup to sweets in great bits of ""wonderful""! And that's been consistent over the years. Kolkatans love MC. By the way, service is really good, just for the record, and the staff will go out of their way to please. Five stars on that count.For me, when you enjoy a buffet, one or two dishes stand out. Well, the chicken wings as starters were excellent. And maybe, just maybe, the chilli fish. After that, nothing really etched a memory on our palate - it was all a blur of same same.I have heard that the chain is doing well. And that could be more and more new fans flocking to it, but for us old timers, re-visiting the past and the city – perhaps Mainland China ought to reinvent some of the dishes and be a little more daring. Otherwise there's always a Tianamen Square lurking ahead. And that's bad food PR.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or440-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

2033,10,30 July 2013,Average Buffet in Taste.. Terrible Incident!!,"Writing this review after several visits to Mainland China. From great buffet it has detoriated to an average tasting buffet. I wont be talking about this though. However, their ala carte is still great. In this review, I will be sharing an incident which occurred with me recently.Went for a Buffet Lunch on a Sunday to Mainland China. We were guided to our table, made comfortable and offered starters, soup on the table. While starters and soup were being served, we sighted a tiny cockroach crawling on the table. (Certainly not expected from a reputed restaurant) We decided not to have lunch, however, the manager apologized enough and made sure that they will take care of us. So we gave him a chance n sat back. We ordered for a Beer and one of the glasses was REALLY DIRTY, which we asked to be replaced. We were served a complimentary fish started from ala carte by the manager, which tasted awesome and we appreciated the gesture. On to desserts, we went for darsan and vanilla ice cream. While having, I got a little piece of cardboard paper in my mouth from the ice cream. 3 things in one lunch went bad.

2061,50,4 April 2013,Best Chinese food in Town,"I believe in their campaign ""if it is Chinese it is Mainland China"". I am a frequent visitor to this place and recently they have started buffet for weekend dinner too. If you like authentic chinese food, this is the place to go. You can even ask them to prepare your dish without MSG and in desert they keep sugar free options too. You must try the Green tea in stead of standard drinks (Green tea is complimentary). Price is 5 Star but it is worth paying for once in a while. I felt the Gurusaday Dutta road (Ballygunj) space is best (other two are South City Mall and Silver Spring) for overall ambience and food experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or470-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

2063,50,21 March 2013,"Mainland China, Gurusaday Road, Kolkata","The Gurusaday branch of Mainland China has always been a favorite. We went there after a long time and after two not-so-happy times at the South City Mainland China outlet.....and were hoping that this restaurant would not have changed its hospitality....and we were so glad we went. Right from the moment we entered the restaurant we were shown the best hospitality. The music was the same, and the ambience as we remembered it.Mr Gautam was assigned to our table and he looked after us very well indeed. One very important thing I noticed and appreciated was that he gave us paper napkins when he served the starters. I thought that was an extremely thoughtful thing because one doesn't want to wipe greasy fingers on the serviettes.The food tasted the same as we remembered, which means that the chef is careful and proud of his standards. It also means that the management here is attentive to the vision of the person whose restaurant chain this is.Cheers Mainland China!!

2193,50,29 August 2011,The Best Chinese Restaurant in Calcutta,"I went to Mainland China for lunch with some of my high school friends. Upon arrival, we were asked whether we would like to dine-in or have buffet. Once we opted for buffet, we were asked to wait for 5-10 mins to let them prepare the table.The buffet cost was a little less than 700 INR per person. And it was ""wonderful"" to describe in one word. We were offered complementary drink choices including light beer and some cold drinks. Starters included a variety of veg & non-veg selection along with a soup. Probably starters were the most delicious items. However, all non-veg starters were chicken only. Once we moved on to main coarse, there were about 4 veg preparations (which we mostly skipped, being hardcore non-veg fans) and one non-veg preparation each of chicken, lamb, prawn, crab & fish. The prawn & fish preparations were most tasty.Moving on to deserts, again there was a wide selection (at least 6-7 items I think). They were pretty good too. And they have a delicious chocolate fountain from which you can take the chocolate sauce for your ice creams (4 flavors). That's a must!Overall, value for money is excellent. And from my past experiences, I would strongly recommend to go for duck items if you are going for à la carte.

2199,30,6 May 2011,"a near ripoff at Silver Spring: Mr Chatterjee, you should be aware of this!","I know Mainland China well, and went there because I wanted to eat reasonably authentic Chinese food in a good ambience: in particular also, because it is one of the few places that serves Peking duck.While the starters were reasonable (although not great), I was shocked to discover that my 'Peking Duck' (we had ordered half a duck, which costs nearly a thousand rupees) consisted of a few tiny, cold, and already filled pancakes with a minuscule amount of meat, and cucumbers and scallions pre-stuffed in them. As if to act as a filler, we were served bowls of 'duck' soup, supposedly, which smelt like tinned chicken soup with a few floating pieces of boiled meat.I know my Peking Duck: when I protested that this was NOTHING like Peking Duck should be and that I would report the matter -- sure enough, half a duck was brought to my table and the skin and meat sliced in our presence as it should be (I was asked, do you want the meat? To which I wanted to say, no, I really would prefer it you took the meat back to the kitchen and ate it, which is what you presumably did the last time around). All the condiments and the sauce were brought in separately, and served to us fresh, to be put on the pancakes. Importantly, the quantity of meat was at least 10 times what we were originally served.Mr Chatterjee, I know that you would have been appalled to see your staff colluding in what was an attempted ripoff. If I had been ignorant of what Peking Duck was, or if I had not been as assertive as I was, I would have been paying nearly a thousand rupees for a meal whose net worth was not more than a hundred, and in additional the taste experience would have been zero (the meat which had been stuffed in the pancakes was not at all crisp, and the condiments were stale, the first time around).Although in the end I was satisfied with the Peking Duck we were served at my insistence (which proved that your staff do indeed know how to make and serve one), I am still in shock at the fact that the manager (presumably) and some of the staff are trying to make money fraudulently by ripping individual customers off.Although I normally recommend your restaurant to friends, this experience has shaken my faith, and I will tell them certainly to avoid your Silver Spring branch of Mainland China unless the management is changed.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or610-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

Also when I presented my credit card for the payment, they kept me waiting for a very long time. This kind of service in such an upscale erstaurant is uncalled for. I doubt I will ever return to that restaurant ever again.I also ate at the one located at South City Mall. This was the lunch buffet. Though there was a lot of variety, I cannot honestly say that this is the best Chinese food I have eaten. I prefer quality over quantity and Mainland China definitely does not stack up to my expectations. The cost for the lunch buffet was reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d786007-Reviews-or620-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Ballygunje, Kolkata

Food is great as well. My experience was going great until I decided to choose regular water. I always go for regular water in such places as places like this have got aqua guard or kent purifier installed. The water was served shortly and my first sip blew off every good things those were revolving around me. The regular water was salty. On my inquiry, the staff got offended and ""challenged me"" to have their water purifiers checked. His behavior was utterly shocking. Finally I was forced to go for mineral water and ""enjoy"" my dinner. Now, such behavior from staffs and services are big turn-offs for anyone. I would never return to that place. I suggest people who go there to choose mineral water and not regular.

This restaurants serves the same version of ""Indian Chinese' food (which has now sprouted up all over Silicon Valley, due to the Indian diaspora there). The food tastes more like Indian curry with Chinese trappings. For instance, I ordered a vegetable stir fry and had to send it back three times - the first time it was loaded with soya sauce (and perhaps MSG too), the next time it tasted like a curry and the third time it was plain inedible.

They offered us a table for 8 at first and then changed it a table for 5 . I sat facing a store room full of broken high chairs , the floor was dirty with food particles and the walls and ceiling was filthy.

Sign of ageing is very apparent. about the food, less said the better. Comparable to what we would say Kolkata street Chinese food available in most areas, at a exorbitant price for the brand. Korean Style lamb had nothing Korean about it. Doused in Indian spices (more of a curry flavour) than Korean, and I can say that I have lived in Korea for a while. Singapore noodles was very ordinary, and the Tsing Hoi chicken was again too pungent to have much taste. The worst of the lot was probably the Stir Fried vegetables, which was probably dead 5 times over, absolutely soggy, doused in soya, Oyster and generous dosage of cornflour!

Little surprised that they didn't bother to do something about it.Coming to the food - it was good as always and as every other Mainland China wherever I have eaten. The duck starter stands out of course. The whole bhetki with choice of sauce for main course was also quite good.The disappointment- They don't have a washroom. This is unbelievable, really.

We tried the roast duck fried rice, which was light and fluffy with a decent smattering of roast duck in it.Unfortunately the other new item, crispy lotus stem with curry leaves/ pepper, was a disappointment as it came deep fried and heavily coated with sugar syrup, basically obliterating the tender, crunchy taste of lotus stems.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d7977591-Reviews-or20-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Silver Arcade, Kolkata

This was our first time at the one on EM Bypass.This one doesn't offer Buffet like the one at Gurusaday Road.We had lettuce wrap (chicken) and chilli prawn for starters and mixed fried rice and a light chicken dish (forgot the name!) for main course. The food was excellent as usual, you don't get much to complain at Mainland China food.This was the first time we took our 2.5 yrs old daughter to Maiinland China, and the way she was treated was fabulous.

2275,50,26 August 2016,"Truly Amazing Experience! Great Food, Great People, Great decor........","Date of Visit: July 23, 2016No of Pax: 06Bill Amount: Rs 12,000 (approx)I should have written this review much earlier but got delayed due to some reasons. Anyway, let me do it now Mainland China is regarded as the Holy Grail of Chinese food in Kolkata. I had their food on a number of occasions but this was the first time I was visiting their Silver Spring outlet with my family. The restaurant is located on the 3rd floor just opposite Oh Calcutta. The entrance to the restaurant and the decor is unique with dim lighting, a small lounge area and Chinese statues all around. There are normal seating arrangements and special enclosures which can accommodate 6 – 7 persons. We had booked an enclosure over the phone, so got one. Our 3 ½ year old daughter was given a high chair – a wonderful gesture on their part.For starters were tried around 6 dishes but crab cakes, prawn siu mai and grilled fish deserve special mention. In fact, they brought the whole bekti to the table wonderfully grilled and ready to eat. The other starters like Drums of Heaven and Golden Fried Jumbo Prawns were good too but crab cakes were really very special. For the main course we ordered Chicken Pan Fried Noodles, Chicken Mei Foon, Mixed Meat Fried Rice, Tempura Fried Rice (Chicken), a lamb side dish (cannot remember the name), Prawns in Oyster sauce, Dry chilli chicken, a duck dish et al. All the items were wonderfully cooked and had a great taste though I personally felt that the duck item was a bit tough although the other members of my family liked it very much. We had Rambutan Ice Cream and Mango Pudding for desserts and you need to see the Rambutan Ice Cream to believe it. It was huge – dollops of vanilla ice cream surrounded by lychees and the whole dish were placed on dry ice, probably, as we could see icy smoke coming out from all sides. A unique experience really and this was not all. As we paid the bill through the HSBC Credit Card the restaurant gave us a Rs 500 Gift Voucher for our next visit. Surely nothing went wrong here. Do come here at least once and enjoy the experience and I am sure you will keep coming back here again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d7977591-Reviews-or40-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Silver Arcade, Kolkata
2276,20,28 July 2016,Lots of expectations but a flop dining experience,"The charm of Mainland China is probably over for us. We have dined at various mainland china restaurants across bangalore and kolkata ever since they started ..Went for lunch, the entrance looks very nice. It's opposite the Oh Calcutta (strange but that's the photo too on this listing in TA :-))Most of the place was empty even on a sunday lunch. Lots of space and the decor was probably conceptualised for something way bigger. On the left side of the restaurant there are circular enslosures separated by some space where the buddha head lies - probably it was supposed to be filled with water??Staff was warm and welcomes us. They were glad to help us with the order.Ambience is good and the tables with round mini tops are attactive.Coming to the food, complete letdown almost all the items were just not worth the price tag. Portion of noodles and rice is really small for the regular and large tag and of course the price.Starters were so so but definitely not something you will expect in mainland china kinda place. The fish was so damn spicy .. we immediately gave the feedback and were offered fountain coke on the house ( minus much fizz;-) )Clay pot chicken with cinnamon flavour was good.. nothing else that was worth remembering.. sob sob.Note: Feedback form filled and discussed at length with manager.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304558-d7977591-Reviews-or40-Mainland_China-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html,Mainland China, Silver Arcade, Kolkata

2279,30,12 June 2016,Average everything,"This review would be unique in the sense that we actually didn't have food at Mainland China,but at Oh!Calcutta,next door.As Mainland China was being renovated at Silver Springs Shopping Arcade on JBS Haldane Avenue (aka E M Bypass), we were surprised to find out that there was a signboard (see accompanying picture) saying Mainland China food will be served at Oh! Calcuuta. Hence the uniqueness of this review , that we had food from Mainland China,but sitting inside Oh! Calcutta.Car parking in Silver Springs is available inside the building,at Rs 30 per hourDecorations inside Oh!Calcutta was bland and very simplistic, with Kolkata skyline etched on glass,and a few old clocks hanging from the wall. It looked that decors inside hasn't been changed since its inception.We went there last Monday for lunch at around 2pm,and were pleasantly surprised to find out,that the place was nearly empty. Later few tables became occupied but the usual din of a restaurant was absent.Waiters were nice but they didn't look like they were working in a A class restaurant. Most of the drinks on menu aren't available. I asked for Hoegarden beer,Not available. Stella ? Not available ? Sir, we only have Corona ! Not good.We ordered few starters and they consisted of Assorted Non Veg Dimsum platter large - which again consisted of Chicken Siu Mai (ordinary tasting,character less),Pan grilled crab cakes ( nice tasting) and Prawn Hargao (again bland and ordinary) and Konjee Crispy Lamb large ( lamb was soft and crispy and taste was really good )The most horrible part was a fish dish,which we had ordered. Thankfully we were NOT charged for that in our final bill. The fish was smelling and raw , and tasted yucck !! All 5 of us could get the smell and asked the waiter to promptly remove it !We had lemon coriander thick prawn soup,which was ordinary tasting. We usually have much better lemon coriander prawn soup at Hyatt Regency,Kolkata.We ordered General Tao's favorite chicken large and Chicken Fried rice large as main course. Chicken fried rice was plain Jane,and we have better fried rice even at Hatari,Kolkata. General Tao's chicken were deep fried and crispy chicken balls in a tangy tasting sauce - not bad,nothing extraordinary.For dessert we ordered plenty of things as we were 5 of us. I ordered a Nolen Gur icecream with nuts,which was really good. One of us had Orange Creme Brulee portion,one had Hot chocolate rolls and vanilla icecream,and two of us had Mainland Sundae portion .Food bill for 5 persons was Rs 4692 with all taxes and cess.Drinks bill (only beer though )with taxes and cess was Rs 3009Washroom was clean and spacious thoughOverall experience was extremely average.Nobody came to apologize for the awful fish dish,not even the chef. Only it wasn't chargedBeen there,done that. Won't ever go back to Mainland China,or recommend anybodyI have a Specialty Restaurant Card,and I have had the privilege of dining at Maachan,Haka,Flame and Grill multiple times.

2285,50,21 July 2015,what an interior and gr8 food,"Went for office lunch here and was pretty amazed with kind of ambiance and interior of the restaurant. At entrance interesting cylindrical foyer will be one's first point of attraction. Innovative separate sitting for your privacy. Servers will ensure you relax before placing order. As complimentary on the table they will serve Kimchi Salad, Cucumber Pickle along with hot cuppa of Jasmine Tea to refresh you.In coolers we had a pitcher of Orangepirosksha along with starters had Crackling Spinach, King Prawns Hunan Style, Keong's Chili Chicken and Veg Spring Roll.Orangepirosksha: Such a refreshing mocktail of fizzy orange juice with chunks of orange and mint leaves. If you are in group then its smart and cost effective choice to order for pitcher.Crackling Spinach: Such a unique and mouthwatering dish where macroscopic slices of spinach leaves deep fried with peanuts and with sprinkle of something similar to chat masala.King Prawns Hunan Style: King size prawns covered with batter drenched in hunan sauce. Nice fresh king prawn and succulent too.Keong's Chili Chicken: Unique chili chicken pieces with coating mixed with green chili and spring onion.Veg Spring Roll: Is an orthodox spring roll but crispy and flaky roll. Noting unique about this though.In main course ordered for Lemon Coriander Thick Chicken Soup, Burnt Garlic Mixed Meat Fried Rice, General Tao's Chili Chicken, Corn and Potato Tsing Hoi Style.Lemon Coriander Thick Chicken Soup: The hot lemon flavour with dices of chicken pieces in thick green coriander soup. Its heavy too so if you have plan for main course then try to split a portion in two.Burnt Garlic Mixed Meat Fried Rice: Mixed meat fried rice with topping of burnt garlic rice to enhance the flavour.General Tao's Chili Chicken: Till now most delicious chili chicken with 12 pieces in large portion. Semi dry gravy dish.Corn and Potato Tsing Hoi Style: Gravy dish with american corn and dices of potato in Tsing Hoi gravy. Bit tangy but acceptable taste.How can we miss to order from tempting list of desserts hence ended up with Hot Chocolate Rolls and Orange Creme Brulee.Hot Chocolate Rolls: Six pieces of molten chocolate rolled with with thin flour batter and topped with coconut flakes. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.Orange Creme Brulee: Custard with topping of caramelized orange slices. Though I didn't find any unique taste of orange in the same.Service was breeze fast and we felt like waiting ages for food. Taste and presentation was out of the world.

Amazing ambiance, hospitality, service. The place attracts good crowd as the restaurant was almost full. Does speak alot about how good this place actually is.Started with Soup, not a big fan of Soup, but the Lung fung chicken & prawns soup was so yummm!! mild soup generous amount of filling, a flavorsome treatChicken & straw mushroom siu-mai dumplings, the dumplings are completely and generously stuffed.Fish in dragon chilli, I personally prefer spicy food and this was my favorite, has good amount of spice and amazing flavors.Dices chicken assorted peppers - again a spicy dish and again my favorite.For the main course ordered Veg Hakka noodles along with Chicken in smoked chili sauce and mandarin fish. Chinese cuisine for me is incomplete without these and oh my the gravies were all rich in flavors.Finally for desserts The chocolate dome - do not miss this highly recommend this, so much goodness in 1 dish, just amazing!!Would like to thank Mr. Pradeep for the suggestions, recommendations the hospitality and service.

The food was good and the variety in the main courses was better than some of the other places. Staff was good but they could improve on attending to the guests a bit more. No one asked us for repeat of starters, which was served at the table and was not part of the buffet. We had to ask for refill of water. Not a big issue but definitely a deterioration from the last time we visited this place. The softy ice-cream was almost melting right from the machine.

2300,10,28 April 2019,Needs an overhaul,"Mainland China is considered 'THE' Chinese restaurant in town, and the one on Church Street has been serving sumptuous dishes since mid 2000. But the good news stops there. I and my son were salivating for Chinese fare and 3 -Quarters Chinese was closed for renovations and Chutney Chang was an option but we walked into Mainland China.The usher was busy over phone, but quickly attended to us. We were guided to our table by another enthusiastic waiter. The options of decent buffet and ala - carte were put across to us. We opted for the non vegetarian buffet.The chicken soup was yum. The momos, chicken lollipop, potatoes were under par. The Fish fry was also good. The waiter volunteered to get another serving of better cooked chicken but again that was okay-ish. We made our way to the main course. I opted for noodles with Prawn red curry. The prawns tasted as if they were taken out from a malfunctioning freezer and put into the gravy. The noodles were not Al Dente. The fish in mustard sauce was good, and yes the prawn gravy was awesome. Did not dare to go for the crabs and chicken.The desserts were a pleasant surprise, honey roasted biscuits, fresh cut Watermelon were top notch. The fruit custard seemed to have been prepared by a rookie pastry chef. I finally gave up, and went for the ice cream and chocolate sauce, obviously no can one go wrong with them, so no complaints there.At the entry, there was a sinage stating 10 year kids can eat at 50% discount. I mentioned this to one of the waiters, he did not come back with a response. Later I enquired with manager and he hesitatingly said it is only for kids upto 9 years. I was not expecting a discount as my son was ten plus but was expecting honesty here and obviously that was missing.Overall, I was disappointed to see the fall from the high quality restaurant it once was. Will I visit this same restaurant again, unfortunately no; but will I visit another Mainland China outlet, yes.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or10-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2303,50,20 February 2019,"Best Chinese food in town, return home very happy and satisfied!","Been to Mainland China on a couple of occasions. Absolutely blown away by the lip-smackingly delicious food and courteous staff.While they do have lunch buffets on offer, we decided to order ala carte dishes. For appetizers, the Crackling Spinach dish is an absolutely must have dish. Mind blowing. Veg spring rolls are crispy and nice. The hot and sour soup is hot and delicious, really good. Crispy cottage cheese with smoked chillies are very filling fulfilling too. Crispy chicken with smoked chillies were a big hit and we ended up googling the recipe as well so that it can be made at home. A very novel dish and very well cooked.For main course, we had a fish dish whose name I cannot recall, but it was delicious. The chicken in black pepper sauce was the least exciting dish, but yummy nonetheless. The usual fried rice and noodles were served hot and well cooked.Service takes some time, but if you get such delectable food at the end, you wouldn't mind. The tablets provided to make selections can be better, they hang and are a little slow. Portion sizes are quite big, so be careful while ordering. The stewards and staff are very polite and helpful and they ensure you're well looked after.Both the Church Street and Indiranagar branches are very tastefully done up. Please do visit Mainland China for authentic and delightfully delicious Chinese food. There are enough options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.

They have a huge franchise of multiple outlets throughout India and only in Bangalore there are 7 outlets. I visited the Church Street Outlet which is next to Oh Calcutta and Hoppipolla.Ambiance: At the entrance, you will be welcomed by 2 lions and 3 Chinese warrior statues. You would feel that you have entered a world within a world. Located on the first floor, they have a really classy ambiance and walls are covered with Buddha paintings. I visited this place with my friends for some weekend treat.The service is really good and the staff is courteous and friendly.We started our dinner with some tea which was good. They had kimchi and cucumber salad kept as a side dish.Beverages:Orange Piroshka: a mocktail which was orange with Basil. It was quite refreshing. I loved it.Kiwi Margaritas: Tequila with Kiwi and Lime, I loved its taste.Virgin Mojito: The best I ever tasted. I loved it because of a well-balanced taste of lime and mint.(All the drinks were up to the expectation)Soup:Pepper Lemon Veg Soup: it was good, I loved the mushrooms they added in that.Appetisers:Crispy Lotus stem with curry leaves and black pepper: this is the second time I tasted lotus stem and I am in love with that. They are just delicious and I would recommend this dish as a must have.Crackling Spinach: it was good, shredded spinach fried and tossed with almonds silvers and sesame seeds. I loved it.Crispy Chili Corn Pepper: This was good.Dimsum:Veg Basil Dumplings: it was good, but I felt something was missing.Main Course:Ginger Capsicum fried rice: It was the best fried rice I ever had. This goes well with all types of sauces.Mixed Vegetable Chili Basil Sauce: It was good. Loved itGreen and Garlic Dry: It was good.Japanese Wheat Noodles Veg: loved it, wok tossed buckwheat noodles with vegetables.

Some dishes, adapted to local taste, is even better than the originals in the east. (E.g: Black pepper fried lotus root). While corn starch is still a bit excessive, it is still within acceptable balance.Dumplings are to DIE FOR.Service could be slightly more attentive and direct order from iPad would have been great.

2317,40,28 August 2018,Craving chinese? I bet you find me a better place.,"Owing to the fact that they have a rating of 4+, I was expecting the food to be much better.I used to live in Kolkata and I can tell that this was almost as good as the outlet there be it a Haka or a Mainland China.I chose to go for the Weekday non veg buffet for Rs 415 AI where I was served a chicken coriander soup followed by chicken dumplings, seafood sui mai(fish and prawn), chicken lollipops, fish in hunan sauce, lemon chilly potatoes, oriental stir fried veg and veg wantons.Chicken dumplings - 5/5 because I am a huge fan of these anyway and they met my expectations.Seafood dumplings - 3/5, there was something terribly wrong with the seasoning!Chicken lollipops - 3/5 Would've been better if they were more crispy than soggy on the crust.Fish in hunan sauce - 4/5, seasoning could certainly be worked upon!Lemon chilli potatoes - 2/5, I could barely taste the tanginess of the lemon juice! It only tasted of chillies.Oriental stir fried veg - 4/5, perfectly seasoned! Only got a little soggy.Veg wantons - 1/5, oily, terribly underseasoned and surprisingly raw insides.Coming to buffets, you either expect the main course to be great or the starters!Quite obviously, I wasn't expecting the main course to be GOOD and not to my surprise, it turned out to be so!I was very excited to see lamb meatballs in schezuan sauce - Disappointing, texture and taste both!The fish in oyester and brocolli sauce was my favourite!Shrimp was decent, but not good.Noodles, was uniformly cooked and well seasoned.Thankfully, the waiters are extremely hospitable and somewhat catered to the needs of my taste buds. The manager that day, Mr Ratnesh replaced the portion of lamb meatballs for me with a brilliant lamb preparation in black bean sauce that was amazing.Coming to desserts, the strawberry pastries were one of the best I'd had in a long time. Same for the caramel custard and the chocolate wantons. Only the kiwi mousse was a little below expectations.I never leave ice creams in a buffet, no matter how fill I am. Hence I undoubtedly tried the softies out of sheer excitement.However, they were not of the right temperature. By the time I got it to my table from the softie machine, it had melted to where it started from and along with it took my all my excitement down.However, I'll undoubtedly come back here and the next time will hopefully be better!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or20-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2327,50,24 February 2018,Mainland China Kalyan Nagar- the best food and service I have seen so far,Went for lunch and enjoyed an excellent meal. The fried spinach was awesome. So was the crab meat. I was then amazed by how the manager and staff went out of their way to help a gentleman who was unable to go down the stairs by carrying him on a chair and helping him to his vehicle. It was just amazing to watch their committment and concern.

I loved the peach apple drink called allure. Since I don't like cocktails which are tangy, this was a good choice for me. The prawn wantons were yum and the fish in sauce for the main course was great too. Only, the sauces kept for the starters didn't have much variety in terms of flavour. Also, they don't serve any soupy broth with noodles, which I would have very much enjoyed. All in all, the experience was good, the service friendly and the pricing not too steep.

2345,40,28 January 2017,Flavourful Rooster,"Come January 28 & we begin the Chinese New Year, & wow, this time, I’m told it’s the year of the Rooster, to be specific Fire Rooster. We decided to ring in the New Year @ Mainland China, our favourite Chinese restaurant, which is hosting a festival for the New Year.The restaurant has a nice well crafted a-la-carte menu, with many rooster-based dishes. My co-diner tried the rooster & coriander siu mai, a nicely textured open steamed dimsum. Then my co-diner relished another starter, that’s the smoked rooster roll, which can be somewhat described as a non-veg version of the veg spring roll. I believe the Sriracha Rooster Wings is slow-cooked & the chili sauce makes it flavourful.I decided to try the Asian potato croquette & I must say the croquette has been tweaked, as it’s sprinkled with parsley & is shallow fried. Quite nice, you know.Of course the must-try starter is the corn som tam with cottage cheese, it’s so chat-patta….lovely.As the meal progressed, several cups of hot jasmine tea did the rounds & it’s so cleansing.Ah, coming to the main course, we together tried the longevity noodles, believed to enhance life & longevity is another hot pick. Mix vegetable fried rice, an all time classic, is best enjoyed with seasonal vegetables with three chillies.Then a Fortune Pot went around from table to table. Luck smiled on my co-diner, a mocktail arrived @ the table, on-the-house. I think it was called Seventh Heaven…quite right… as there’s a feel good factor about it.Do leave space for dessert, chosen from the regular menu. Date ice cream with almond flakes is a must-have as it’s so creamy & textured.Vathsala",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or50-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

This restaurant is located on Church street and is located on the 1st floor of the building. The interiors looked a bit shabby. But we went there to try the Sunday Buffet Lunch.The Buffet started with Dimsums and almost all had a very thick outer layer making them chewy. Next we tried the Tomato Basil Soup which was ok in taste. The buffet had very limited dishes when it came to veg starters. The main course had a couple of items like the Veg Noodles, Capsicum Fried Rice, Potato and Tofu Sweet Chilli Sauce, Veg Manchurian, Thai Veg Curry, steamed rice and so on. The Thai Curry with Steamed rice was delicious. But the Veg Manchurian was a bit salty. The Veg Noodles were good though. The desserts were so so except for the fried sweet wantons.The restaurant has definitely lost its charms and its high time to revamp the place as well as the menu.

There were only 5 tables that were occupied. we asked for the manger. The neighbouring table family also asked for the manager since the service was pathetic. the manger was busy on the computer. Finally, we got up to have the main course. the manager got a earful from us. He did not swipe the speciality restaurant member card and hence the points were not credited.

2394,30,30 March 2015,Outrageously priced average food,"I have been to several Mainland China outlets - Mumbai (Saki Naka), and Bangalore (near MG Road, and Indiranagar), and have seen the transformation of this food chain over the years. They had started out in late nineties as a value for money Chinese restaurant. The food always was decent like several other similar Indian-Chinese restaurants. Then they started changing themselves about ten years back. They still served the same food, but the food presentation improved. So did the ambience - all the outlets started getting a premium makeover. At the same time, they jacked up the price exorbitantly, and reduced the food portions.Today Mainland China is an overpriced eatery. I would rate the food only slightly above average compared to the run-of-the-mill Indian Chinese restaurants, but priced way above them. I have stopped visiting them since.To be fair, it is still a nice Indian Chinese restaurant that serves decent food. The new ambience feels great. Be careful while ordering, as the portions are small. Finally, be prepared to shell out a bomb.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or100-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore
2395,30,25 March 2015,Alright as an option to provide variety,"Their buffet used to be much better. We visited today and found that the veg starters were pathetic, they were served at an abysmal pace and the hakka noodles looked and tasted like they were made by some amateur. The rest of the stuff was good though and service was fine too.I see some others have rated this place as VFM based on ala carte prices which I can't quite fathom as to how they made that assessment. The buffet still delivers VFM since you get to sample a large variety of fairly good dishes.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or100-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

The variety of dishes on offer is quite good, although vegetarians might prefer more. The salads could be enhanced as well - the flavours are good overall. Desserts were excellent. Excellent value for money!!Couple of improvements though:Crab claws should be cracked before being put on the buffet so that it's easy to get to the meat inside.The chafing dishes for the buffet tend to slip a bit and also are a little loose - including the ice cream station - should be looked into.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or110-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2403,50,20 February 2015,Begin the New Year with zesty flavours,"Come on, the Chinese New Year has just begun on February 19, so how could we miss the fun? We headed to Mainland China to catch up on all the excitement. Tall sugarcanes greeted us at the entrance. Mainland China came out in all its glory, complete with all its paraphernalia.Though the buffet was exhaustive, we gave it a skip and chose from a-la-carte menu. Fresh vegetables, exotic Chinese herbs and spices are the highlights of the festival.We began the meal with crispy veggies with kaffir lime. By themselves, crispy veggies are enjoyable. Kaffir lime gives it a distinct edge. While the zest of the lime adds a unique flavor, the leaves of kaffir lime add a refreshing tinge to the veggies. I’ll definitely recommend this.My friend settled down for barbecue pepper chicken. As for this starter, its highlight is the Sichuan pepper, which is somewhat citrusy and aromatic. Of course, there are plenty of other starters to choose from, but we moved on to the main course.Wok Stir fried noodles is known to be fresh and helps preserve the colour and texture of food. Having said that, at this festival, stir fried noodles combines with succulent prawns and crab meat. My friend who tried this described it as amazing. For the main course I chose Bamboo rice with veggies. It arrived in a tall bamboo tube and as the container opened, it let out a mild fragrance. Though it’s been a staple of people from the hilly regions, bamboo rice over the years has become a delicacy, sought after for being light and fragrant.There’s a fine mix of veg and non veg dishes. My co-diner was tempted to try the spicy peppercorn chicken with golden garlic because it was served in a smoked claypot, which is known to retain the flavour of the food.The restaurant was packed to capacity and as the meal progressed the Chinese New Year booklet was handed out to guests. The Chinese Zodiac is based on a 12-year cycle and each year symbolizes an animal sign. This time, it’s the year is the Year of the Wooden Sheep or Wooden Goat and guests were trying to figure out what’s in store for them this year. Incidentally, this is the 4713th Chinese Year.In all, the Chinese New Year menu at Mainland China is a must-have for food lovers.Kavitha",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or110-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore
2404,30,19 February 2015,Good Chinese but Very Expensive,"I am a fan of Mainland China's food but I have rated it only 3. While the food remains very good and the ambience is excellent, over the years many other chinese restaurants have come up that serves equally good food at lower prices. Moreover, I suspect that the taste of the food varies from outlet to outlet. The taste is best in its original outlet on Church Street (after it shifted from St. Marks Road) but is not so in its Indiranagar 100ft road outlet. The food in one of its earliest outlets on Gurusaday Road, Kolkata is still awesome. Even I suspect that the menu also varies as well as the prices like in their outlet in Hiranandani Estate, Powai, Mumbai. While this may be a good business strategy to maximise profits based on market capabilities, from a perspective of a 'brand' it is not strictly ethical. Mainland China may look into this aspect. I have stopped going to Mainland China in Bangalore, as I find that it is no longer 'good value for money' as I am not one of those types who like to tell about the places I eat in. For showing off I have the 5 star hotels!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or110-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2441,30,30 September 2014,No more the same place,"Its always a challenge when a stand alone speciality restaurant of repute becomes a chain. The consistency and quality of your product suffers, because as much standard recipes and cooking procedures are established for your chefs/cooks to follow at the outlets, theres always a value add by the individual chef/cook. While sone of the ala carte dishes continue to impress in church street, some of the outlets are best avoided. Some outlets are best avoided for home drlivery/ take aways for sure. The buffet is absolutely no value for money. For the money paid, the number of dishes and choices are so few, it dsnt make sense. Most south easy asian cuisines use minimal ingredients and often inexpensive ingredients. Its popularity n taste is supposedly coz of tge cooking techniques and balance of ingredients. But am always surprised to see them being as expensive or more expensive than some restaurants serving cuisines of supposedly more expensive variety, specially for a chain restaurant.

2450,50,26 July 2014,Flavours of Asia beckon,"I was personally happy to find a food festival titled Asia Kitchen Festival hosted by Mainland China. After all, we don’t usually a chance to sample delicacies from Indonesia or Malaysia.We began the meal with a Malaysian Crispy Lotus Stem with Black Pepper and Curry Leaves. This starter is a must-try for the crispiness of the lotus stem which is only enhanced by the black pepper. Since we are so used to curry leaves in our food, the presence of curry leaves brought us into familiar territory.My friend enjoyed the shitake mushroom satay, held together with crispy fried glass noodles. What to look out for is the presentation. I must say this looked like a cute cake from a distance. Even the dynamite tofu on a bed of cabbage leaves presented in a cocktail glass, looked nice.I’m told that the Java grilled fish with sambal sauce was spicy and refreshing & the starter was just right for conversation. My co-diner also relished the barbequed pepper chicken. The oriental sauce gave a flavourful hint to the crispy vegetables.Endless cups of Chinese tea arrived at the table as the meal progressed. Coming to the main course, the Chicken Kaprao was a hit with my co-diner. Minced chicken was stir fried with basil was contrasted with the soy sauce, which made it interesting.Mee Goreng, an Indonesian street food is a must-try. There’s a veg and non-veg version too of this noodles. What made it different was that it was light. Full marks to the Thai curry served with a bowl of rice. This is one of the best Thai curries known outside Thailand. Its beauty lies in its simplicity and fresh flavours. Thoroughly enjoyable dish & very filling too.We ended the meal with our favourite brownie served with chocolate sauce, this is from the regular menu.It’s a varied varied pan-Asian offering, which serves some of the best dishes from Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia, among others.It was a-la-carte menu but some of these Asian dishes were also in the buffet. What you need to watch out for is the finely seasoned beautifully plated food.Vathsala",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or150-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2507,50,13 September 2013,The Best Indian-Chinese food in Bangalore,"This review is for the Mainland China branch in Whitefield, Bangalore. If you yearn for good, high quality Indian-Chinese food in Bangalore, then make a bee line to one of the many branches spread over the city. Having eaten at several of their locations over the past 10 years, it is amazing how they have maintained a consistent high quality of food at every location. A food connoisseur would have a tough time trying to find fault with their food. Service is simply awesome – given the fact that in India, customer service has a long way to go in meeting International standards.Highly recommended are their hot & sour soup, Lettuce wraps, crispy baby corn, crispy spinach, Pepper chicken, Golden honey prawns. However, I did find the Sichuan Chicken to be quite bland and tasteless – maybe because I love spicy food. Will not order that again. Also, they did not have diet coke even though it was clearly listed on their menu. They did offer diet pepsi instead. Old Monk Rum lovers beware - they do not serve this. Pricing is equivalent to a 4 star upscale restaurant. Expect to spend INR 400 to 500 per dish. Approx. INR 800 – 1200 per person without alcohol. Dress code suggested is semi–formal.Food Quality – A+Ambiance – ACustomer Service – A+Pricing – AOverall Rating: AWould I visit again: Definitely YES!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or200-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore
2508,50,10 September 2013,Veggie Wonders,"I’m a fan of Mainland China and it’s been more than a year since I visited the outlet at the Orion Mall. The excitement of Ganesh Chathurthi was over and fortunately it had stopped raining. We felt the time was right and headed to the Orion Mall.The 120-seater restaurant scores for its stylish interiors. Done up in the usual red and black tones, what probably makes this place different is that it is designed to offer privacy for big groups of diners. Neat paneling differentiates the various sections of the restaurant and yet all sections don’t look disjoint. What's more the restaurant overlooks the water body, which makes it soothing.We decided to ignore the lunch buffet and opted for a diverse a-la-carte spread, and this time we tried the veg menu. I must say, Mainland China has sensibly balanced its offerings, with a fairly good spread of veg dishes.We had a nice thick fruit punch, after which a whole lot of veggie starters arrived. The crispy chili corn was the best. The crunchiness of the corn was matched by the casing that contained it. It went well with the garlic sweet sauce. For the uninitiated it tasted somewhat like bhel. Ever since the dimsum festival was held sometime ago, dimsums have been a hit with foodies. So we too tried the pan fried spinach-cabbage dumpling. It turned out to be a healthy bite, considering it is first steamed, then pan-fried & finished with sesame oil. Generous portions of soup were served, before the main course. Soft music played in the background, as the meal progressed.We tried the Golden Garlic Fried Rice, whose subtle aroma lingered on the palate. This was accompanied by some basic crispy vegetables. Soft noodles was also enjoyable.Of course, the kimchi and endless cups of Chinese tea added to the overall flavour.We finally rounded off the meal with the famous Chinese dessert Honey Datsun. Crisp honeyed strips gave out a nuttiness which was irresistible.It was a delightful meal at Mainland China.Kavitha",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or210-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

Some 'small bites' festival was going on and we ordered dimsums from that menu and it was no where near to proper chinese dimsums.Apart from this most of the things were pretty good.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or210-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2517,50,8 August 2013,Clear Soups & Crackling Spinach anyone?,"It was a cold misty morning and we needed something to keep us warm. A bowl of clear soup seemed the best option and we headed to Mainland China in Jayangar.We began the meal with a peppery lemon clear soup. Light and flavourful, the peppery punch in the soup was just right to pep up our mood. My co-diner tried a burnt garlic soup, which turned out to be equally enjoyable.When it came to appetizers, we chose crackling spinach. It may be a simple and basic dish, but it’s cooked to perfection and is a fast seller here. My co-diner opted for a non-veg dimsum platter. I’m told that it had a little bit of everything, which was either baked or steamed. It’s this variety that made the dimsum platter interesting.Coming to the main course, we opted for exotic veggies and chili basil sauce in a clay pot. I must say there’s something mystical about a clay pot, more so as the dish has gravy, which suits the Indian taste buds. My co-diner was so fascinated that she too decided to have a clay pot offering and ordered a maoshi chicken in a clay pot. I’m given to understand that this diced chicken dish bears a cinnamon flavor, which gives it a characteristic touch. Though it is new on the menu, it already has a fan following. Whole sea bass which comes with different sauce options is also popular pick.We relished a bowl of the regular veg fried rice with wok tossed veggies. Finally we rounded off the meal with a spring roll ice cream. This is typically Chinese, where a dollop of ice cream is neatly cased within a spring roll.Though this is the smallest among all Mainland China outlets in the city it has all the elements that one would find in any Mainland China restaurant. The place may be compact, but it is designed aesthetically, complete with the wood panel, mirrored walls, Buddha icons and the black and red colour tones.A special word for the well mannered staff.It’s worth a visit.Kavitha",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or210-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore
2518,40,8 August 2013,Lipsmackingly good....,"Had a great dining experience in the Whitefield Road branch. The dim sum was great and the claypot spicy pomfret was delectable. For desserts, the sizzling chocolate brownie was good fun - a facial and a dessert! The spring roll dessert with ice cream was a disappointment, you didn't have the contrast of hot and cold, so may aswell stick to a bowl of standard vanilla icecream.Will definitely be returning and will try out the lunches as recommended by other diners.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or220-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore
2519,40,6 August 2013,Excellent Choice of Food,"Recently I have visited the Mainland China Restaurant near Whitefield, Bangalore. I must say they still maintain the same variety of choices with excellent taste.

Just FYI, if you are a fish lover don't hesitate to try their 'Vetki' fish recipe.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or220-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore
2520,50,1 August 2013,Best Chinese Food In Bangalore @ Mainland China,"hi - if you are a fan of chinese food, then Mainland China is the place to go in Bangalore. I have tried their 3 outlets in the city namely @ Church Street, Orion Mall and Koramangala. All the 3 are exceptional... If you want to go easy on your pocket but try a variety of cuisines, then i would highly recommend their lunch buffets. Else - I am a great fan of their prawn curry, chicken noodles, vegetarian fried rice, momos..etc.. and i could go on an on. The menu is quite elaborative, although alacarte may be on a little expensive side, but still worth it. I am also impressed with the options of food portions - .. something which you will really see value in!

2521,50,25 July 2013,Excellent chinese cuisine,"Any foodie in bangalore who loves chinese would have surely visited Mainland China, church street.Their first branch of remains their best, and still draws in huge crowds on weekends. And i can say for sure, the quality here is still far above their other new branches.We dropped by for a sunday lunch with family, and it's good we had made a reservation, as the place was totally full.You have the option of both buffet as well as ala carte, and we opted for the buffet simply because of the much larger variety we could sample besides the fact that we had a movie to catch.The decore of the place is not fancy, and it's a high end restaurant, so we are spared the red dragons and dingy lanterns.The seating, lighting and layout is perfect and ensures your focus remains solely on the food.We were served soup and a variety of starters on the table. The soup was really good, both sweet corn chicken as well as eight treasure veg.Starters had a lot of options for veg, and i liked the dimsums as well as the babycorn dish.Chicken also was well cooked, tender and flavourful.We went on to have the rice and noodles along with veg and non veg gravies. I particularly liked the shredded chicken in sauce and the lamb dish. The squids were not as per my liking, didn't seem too fresh.The dessert options were not bad either, they had a very light and airy mousse which was fresh and had a lovely strawberry taste.The brownie was soft and not too sweet and they had 4 flavours of ice creams as well.The service also stands out here, and despite the rush, somebody is always there to attend to you.I felt it was a good outing and the price paid was worth the quality and service, so i would recommend it highly to people who havent been here yet.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or220-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore
2522,50,23 July 2013,Chinese Flavours,"We visited Mainland China in Koramangala as we had heard so much about the place. To begin with, a word about the tastefully done interiors. Designer black panels separate seating areas and give sufficient privacy for everyone. The restaurant is spacious and has a split seating arrangement as well. A combination of ceiling lights and table lights matched a fine collection of Chinese artifacts and added charm to the place.Even as we were soaking in the ambience, small portions of kimchi arrived with sauces in cute containers, followed by starters. Since we wanted to spend a quiet afternoon with the family, we opted for the a-la-carte menu, which is exhaustive.Corn cubes turned out to be the best starter. Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, these nicely diced cubes were served with spring onion sauce. The secret to good Chinese food lies in the quaint sauce preparations and Mainland China has got the flavours and textures right. I liked the potato in bar-be-que sauce, which gave it a slight tanginess. Lettuce wraps with vegetables and sweet chili sauce was a wholesome starter. My co-diner tried both Conji crispy lamb and jumbo prawns.While the meal was punctuated with endless cups of jasmine tea, we ordered the main course. My co-diner chose steamed fish, which is a signature dish. I’m told that many Chinese dishes are batter fried, and since this one is steamed, it is a popular choice of many. I had a bowl of Chinese Hakka noodles, which was well turned out and was a perfect dish with the crispy vegetables. Then the fried rice came, where the crunchy corn merged well with the rice. Soft Chinese piped music played in the background.Finally when it came to the dessert, we treated ourselves to the date and jaggery ice cream. This textured, slightly coarse delicacy is a must-try. I don’t think it’s available anywhere in Bangalore except here.Things like valet parking & courteous staff make a difference.Vathsala",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or220-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2525,50,7 July 2013,Dimsum Delights,"I heard Mainland China is hosting the Yum Cha Festival, which packs in the goodies like dim sums. Naturally I decided to try some and ended up doing an entire meal of dim sums with endless cups of light Chinese tea, which is a good digestive.We decided to try both steamed and pan fried dumplings. While the steamed ones were soft, the pan fried dumplings were crisp. And that’s what makes dim sums exciting, there’s something for everyone, in terms of tastes and textures.We began our meal with Chinese cabbage and mushroom dumplings. These steamed dumplings arrived neatly cased in translucent paper-thin wheat starch dough. Crispy cabbage blended well with mushrooms. Then we tried Asian Greens Shanghai Dumplings, garden fresh vegetables covered in dough and pan-fried till crisp. As they were accompanied by sauces and dips like soy sauce, vinegar, a dash of sesame oil and chili sauce, they make a complete meal.My co-diner tried pan fried almond prawns, which were crisp, fresh & delicious. Crunchy almonds contrasted with succulent prawns. Then my co-diner ordered steamed lamb and leek dumplings, which I’m told was interesting because slow cooked lamb combined with leek. Chinese vegetables are a hit with seafood, and are must-try items.Generally dim sums may be round or crescent-shaped, boiled or pan-fried, with a variety of fillings that range from veggies to non-vegetarian fillings. Taste too differs, from sweet to savory. Once you get the wheat starch right, everything falls into place. Mainland China has got its formula in place.There’s something romantic about these dim sums. Served in quaint wicker or bamboo baskets, these cute looking bite portions touch your heart. Quite literally; because that’s what dim sums mean. With that, comes the health quotient, as dim sums are steamed and baked, though some are also pan fried. They are served in individual portions and are quite filling. Mainland China is known for its exotic sauces and these dim sums were delightful with their accompaniments.In all, the Yum Cha Festival was worth every bite, they make nice take-aways.Kavitha",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or220-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

Firstly the quality of the food is gone down drastically, the iced tea served tastes like pure lime juice and during my last two vists I had to remind them that they need to get the iced tea right. There is a lot of food to choose from but I have noticed the same dishes whenever I go there. My bad luck?? My local friends have also been complaining regarding the quality of the food.

The reservation desk and the valet service is pleasant. You must be wondering why, then I have given such a rating to that place... read onOn the other hand, if we talk about their branch in Whitefield area in BLR, its the complete opposite. The only thing that matches the Church street branch is the menu and the name plate. The food is a complete let down. THey say that there is no reservations after a certain time during the weekend. Our reservations was not taken, so we had to go in without one. WE had an infant in tow as well. Once we reach the place, we were made to wait outside. I saw many tables inslde with ""Reserved"" notes. Even after the time they said there are no reservations, people were actually walking in with a reservation. So that's that. I was left wondering who that ""No-reservations-after-a-certain-time"" was meant for!!Now, coming to food:The starters are a let down; the main course is a NO-NO. I was highly disappointed with the quality of food. It just made me wonder if this place is actually owned by the same people that run the Church street restaurant. I have been to this place 3 times in the last 3 months, and I have tasted their food deteriorating with every visit. One thing I learnt; not to visit this place (Whitefield branch) because it is close to one's place of stay. If you really want to enjoy Chinese an Mainland China, then I suggest visiting the Church street branch only...I will never make the mistake of visiting any other Mainland China other than at Church street.Mainland China, Whitefield - No Alcohol.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or250-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2601,50,23 November 2012,Parfait!!! 10 on 10,"The food is excellent at this place for connoisseurs of fine dining. I have tasted authentic chinese food outside India and can state that this place is a close Indian replica of the same and blends the best of Hakka Chinese (the Indo chinese) and the native chinese dishes of dumplings (momos) and Duck/Chicken/Lamb recipes. By the way, authentic chinese is a little hard for Indian taste buds with fish served on a platter with its body intact, just as though it were picked from the sea 10 minutes after your order. All in all, by this standard definition the food just stops short of being 100% authentic chinese, but still is precisely what one wants -- food well cooked/with semblances of flavour.The atmosphere was good. Most of the people around the surrounding tables fall into the categories of large families or group of friends or couples enjoying a good meal.Just ensure you walk in with enough cash on your wallet. A meal for two minus any aperitifs (starters), with just two main courses and two desserts can go upto Rs.1500, but then again, isn't fine dining supposed to be pricey?

The choise of food was authentic and good. Being a vegitarian, after the initial drinks along with couple of starters, we ordered Hot & Sour soup. We decided not to go for any fancy items on the main course but to stik to the usual Noodles and fried rice along with sausy Manchurians. We closed the dinner with a nice desert, The service here was excellent and efficient. You have the satisfaction of having a good Chinese food.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or300-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2608,40,8 November 2012,Good ol Chinese food,"The food is as Chinese as it gets. Nicely adapted dishes for the Indian taste but without sacrificing authenticity. But there are many dishes which you should try which bring out the real Chinese food experience, which many cheap so called Chinese restaurants will never offer you. My wife loves Chinese food and she just can't get enough of this place. You cannot go wrong with this place if you are looking for real recipes. It tends to get crowded and noisy on weekends but you can't help it, otherwise the ambiance is good. Best of all is the buffet, you will never be short changed and will be offered a full range experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or310-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2625,50,29 August 2012,Top-Class Buffet. Truly Chinese,"Mainland China Church Street Buffet has been one of our favourite lunch places. Visiting after a gap, we found the courses top-of-the-line, the spread excellent and no drop in quality. Lovely dimsums and excellent soup were served at the table. The main course had several additions including crabs, basa fish and lamb -- I remember it was only prawn and chicken earlier.Salads and made-to-order stir-fried vegetables only added heft to the menu. All courses were cooked very well, very tasty.The icing on the cake, however, was the fabulous dessert spread. I think it beats several five-star buffet in this.

We ordered some veg and non-veg gravies, rice and noodles.Overall I didn’t find value for money here.

2635,40,18 August 2012,Tasty Dinner,"I had dinner at the new Mainland China location at Orion Mall in Bangalore (26/1, Dr. Rajkumar Road Malleswaram, Rajajinagar, Bangalore - 560 055) while on a quick work trip. The restaurant is on the ground level with an outside entrance facing the fountain. When I arrived at the mall around 7:30pm on a Saturday night, the restaurant was only half-full, however by the time I was ready to eat around 9pm, there was about a 15 minute wait for a table. There was still quite a few people waiting for a table when I left at 10:30pm, so if you don't want to wait, eat at Western hours. The restaurant is nicely decorated, although slightly cramped, so at peak hours it can get a little bit noisy. The menu has a very wide variety of Chinese dishes, some slightly adapted for an Indian audience (lamb and chicken instead of beef and pork, more vegitarian choices). Nobable was the very large selection of soups. I had some lamb dumplings, sweet corn soup, and egg fried rice. Everything was brought out piping hot, freshly prepared, and very well cooked. Each dish was delicious, and obviously made with high quality ingredients. The service was not quite as attentive as many similar restaurants, however they were extremely busy, and the slower service was obviously due to the servers having too many tables as opposed to lazy servers. Prices were very reasonable for a nicer restaurant (starters $4-7, mains $8-12). Portions were very generous, and I almost could have split my meal with another person. If you are looking for good Chinese food in Bangalore, Mainland China is a good option.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or330-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2641,50,24 July 2012,Flavourful culinary journey,"Mainland China has tasted success, thanks to its food festivals and its location. This time we dropped in to try out its new menu as Chef Xhong and Chef Gao Fu Fuliang have flown down from the Sichuan Province of China to create a culinary spread. This new variety has undergone successful trails before hoardings went up in the city to attract diners.Even a glance at the menu revealed that the offering is balanced, wholesome and nutritive, as many dishes are baked and steamed. For instance, there’s a baked vegetable puff, which has the crispness of a puff, but is fortunately spared of its greasiness because it is baked. There’s the steamed chicken puff for non vegetarians. Another popular variant is the steamed fish which carries the promise of a sharp Pixiang bean sauce.For the main course, the broken noodles with zucchini is light, while the pepper fried rice particularly suits those who enjoy spiciness. Some of the dishes which were a hit during the food festivals have been incorporated into the new offering. Like the dimsum festival titled Yumcha clicked well with foodies and urged the hotel to create a flavourful dimsum platter as part of normal fare. While this made for a healthy start, there was the longevity ginseng soup. This herb-infused soup is a nice way to begin the meal. As the name suggests, this soup was chosen for the longevity festival that the hotel hosted.One of the reasons for Mainland China’s success is its location and nothing exemplifies this better than Church Street, where it is located. The hotel has its regulars on weekdays, many of whom tucked into the new a-la-carte menu.You can round off the meal with a date ice cream. Those familiar with Oh! Calcutta will know it is served there. Both Oh! Calcutta and Mainland China are part of the Speciality Group.Overall, it’s a well planned menu.Kavitha Srinivasa",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or340-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2656,50,19 June 2012,China Beckons,"The new Mainland China restaurant at the Orion Mall is amazing. It has a view to die for, with its outdoor seating that overlooks the water body. It lives up to its name, Mainland China, with a red deco indoors. It sports a very sophisticated look, with a screen that gently bifurcates the restaurant into two portions, where each portion is imaginatively lit. I was accompanied by a senior citizen who had difficulty in reading the menu card.Before we realized it, the steward had kindly offered a selection of spectacles to choose from. That was a very thoughtful gesture. The restaurant is sensitive to people of different age groups.Coming to the food, we tried baby corn which was crisp as ever. Clear soup made for a perfect beginning. The noodles with vegetables in sweet-sour sauce was wholesome. The fried rice was very flavourful. All portions come in the form of generous helpings. A warm walnut brownie topped with chocolate sauce and nuts was simply heavenly. it's the same standard and quality that one can find at the other Mainland China outlets in the city. As usual, there's ample choice for vegetarians & non vegetarians as well.But the ambience here is amazing.Worth trying.Kavitha S",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or350-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

Main course was all right :O and the dessert section was good :).

The food didnt taste all that good compared to the first time. At 585 all inclusive on a weekday and 697 all inclusive on a weekend - Lunch.I personally felt I didnt get my moneys worth of food and came away a lil disappointed.

I still remember the pepper fried mushrooms. Super yummy.There is 2 varieties of noodles, 2 varieties of fried rice, 3 to 4 main course each on Lamb, Fish, Chicken, and similar with Veg also. Theres a lot of condiments, like, Prawn wafers, honey dipped noodles etc.All the dishes are kept in an induction stove and they are constantly refilled.Worth every penny.If you are dieting, dont even think of this place, they will break your diet for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or370-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

A lift is available...Thet serve a very good buffet during lunch with some frills on the weekends; which is when it tends to get full and a booking is definitely required. A La Carte is also available, ofcourse.The starters in the buffet are very good and care is taken to serve them on the table itself - (1) ensuring that they are served in order (2) served warm and (3) reduces the footfall near the buffet...There are about two Non Veg and and two Veg starters and over six to seven dishes on the buffet in veg. and non-veg. covering most of the meats.If you are not careful, you may end up filling your self with starters alone...The Food is great but a little Pricey.....",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or380-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

2690,40,31 January 2012,broad range of Chinese cuisine with ying-yang balance,"In a country where popular Chinese food is obsessively, monotonously Indianised, it's difficult to tell the food of one Chinese province from the other. Yunnan, Beijing, Shanghai, Hunan, Hebai, Canton, Sichuan and such become indistinguishable. Luckily As customers become more discerning, there are Chinese restuarants getting better focussed. A great example is the Mainland China chain.On our visit, we opted for the afternoon buffet. It gave a chance to savor the spread and then go back for a second helping. There were some great dishes. 'They have opposing flavours - sweet with bitter, sour with sweet, sweet and spicy', explained a friendly chef, 'There is a ying and yang, hot and cold, contrasting taste, colour...' Both the veg and fish, meat dishes were superb. The steamed sea bassa, crab-cakde, grilled shrimp and the chicken dishes were excellent.

The staff was amazing, very courteous and the attendants were very patient while we browsed through their menu. Their fish schezwan was awesome and thereafter whatever we ordered for was very average. The dumplings were falling apart during serving itself. The noodles were pretty dry (glass noodles). It could have been done better. For the dumpling sauce, the staff did go out of their way to fry the garlic and bring us what we desired. Overall, good experience, soothing ambience, overpriced food(though certain selection might really be good), and excellent staff.

A lift is available...Thet serve a very good buffet during lunch with some frills on the weekends; which is when it tends to get full and a booking is definitely required. A La Carte is also available, ofcourse.The starters in the buffet are very good and care is taken to serve them on the table itself - (1) ensuring that they are served in order (2) served warm and (3) reduces the footfall near the buffet...There are about three to four starters and over six to seven dishes on the buffet in veg. and non-veg. covering most of the meats.If you are not careful, you may end up filling ypourself with starters alone...This restuarnt is very chinese (Haka and Cantonese styles of cooking, I think) and will continue to do well as long as they control the budget.I wish them all the best!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d800980-Reviews-or410-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Church Street, Bangalore

They actually keep a database of special occasions like birthdays and wedding anniversary's and call you on the day.The food varies between good to average. Avoid the Chefs special menu. I have tried a few of the dishes and found them to be a bad experiment. The best dishes would be chicken dim sum and fried and crispy chicken. The noodles are good too. A few dishes are not up to the mark.The seating of the place is really bad, very uncomfortable, the interiors are irrelevant and speak nothing of Chinese.Overall a decent place. Try their lunch buffets which is good value for money.If your a die hard Chinese fan then do visit Zen at the Leela or Schwan court at the oberoi hotel.

Menus were handed over to the gents first, as was the food! My host had to point this out to the otherwise eager waiters!The food was a disappointment. We’d all eaten better at wedding receptions!

Rice, spaghetti topped with veg gravy. The description of the food nowhere matched to the food served.The rice item was plain rice with a pinch of salt and black pepper.

Had the booked the place in advance, so we had our table and the Valet was also helpful in find a place to park in otherwise very-busy saturday evening.As we got seated, the attendants were prompt to come over and give us the menu card, water and asking what we want to eat, to which we asked for a few minutes. we had three children in the group.After we decided what we want to eat, started all the disorganized journey. The drink was awful to taste, had to be replaced. Simple food took a long time to serve, one can understand what happens with hungry children when food takes long to arrive - they started getting crazy. More so, the music being played was so loud and noisy. There were a few tables with even smaller children, screaming at the top of their voices, and the hotel management did not make effort to manage that.Our food dot even more delayed, due to reasons not mentioned to us. They served the starters and we had to wait for another long stretch to get main course. Same happened with the desert. Some of us decided not to order desert else it would delay us even further.I asked to senior looking attendants, about why so much of chaos, both of them were rude enough to not answer anything on that. Did not leave a very good taste in me.Food was OK though. When it comes to cost, we had to spend a lot for all the disappointment - I think it was not worth the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d949963-Reviews-or100-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Feet Road, Bangalore

The taste isnt any better than a me-too Indian-Chinese restaurant. The starters served on the table have waiters frowning when you ask for a repeat.We have never gone wrong with a la carte though, so am not sure the reason why their buffets lack character.

2865,50,5 January 2015,Best of all Mainland Chinas :D,"This is my favorite restaurant in town. I love Chinese cuisine and I love Mainland China so much so that I definitely try to explore this chain every city I visit. The weekend buffet is way too good to keep yourself away from it. I have never returned home unhappy or dissatisfied from Mainland China.This one's located just at the entrance of 100 ft road of Indiranagar while getting in from Koramangla or Domlur. They have valet parking which is very convenient given the location of this restaurant. The a-la-carte menu has a variety of options and the food is quite good. The buffet spread is huge and has a good balance of veg and non-veg dishes , both in starters and main course.Food - Really love their chicken basil dimsums - steamed.One f the greatest discovery is their ""Eight treasure soup"" - DO NOT MISS IT. I have recommended it to many and all have loved it. Same goes for ""Lotus leaf wrapped rice with corn kernels"".Pan fried noodles is yummy with ample of vegies (I feel hungry as I am writing this review).Other delicious fares are : Sweet & Spicy Crispy Chicken, shredded chicken in green and red pepper.Well, if you are trying out the weekend lunch buffet - please don't miss out on anything. Last saturday I was there for lunch - and every single dish was worth the time, money and definitely the taste buds. Try the chicken and shrimp toasts, chicken wings, fried vegetables, garlic fish.All in all - a must try and definitely worth the multiple and frequent visits",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d949963-Reviews-or110-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Feet Road, Bangalore

The main course had noodles, chopsuey, rice with nicely prepared sides which included prawn, fish, crab, lamb and chicken. The deserts were a pleasure as well with ice cream,s custards, darshans and various cakes.Overall I can say this branch of Mainland China is equally good as the main branch at Gurusaday Road, Kolkata..

2886,50,11 November 2013,Lovely lunches,"We decided to celebrate a family member’s birthday at Mainland China (MLC), 100 Feet Road Indiranagar. We had visited many MLC outlets in the city but we were yet to pay a visit here.The spacious seven-year-old restaurant is spread across two floors. We headed to the first floor and treated ourselves to one of the most enjoyable meals. We skipped the buffet and ordered from the a-la-carte menu.We whetted our appetite with kimchi, before settling for our favourite fruit punch, served in a tall stem glass. MLC is known for its extensive starter range. We had a nice healthy corn and water chestnut dumpling. This steamed dimsum was wholesome, and was much cherished with a Chinese sauce. And of course, the crackling spinach was equally delicious. One of our co-diners relished a plateful of pan fried Huang prawn.MLC on 100 Feet Road had people swarming in for the lunch buffet. The place is centrally located for office-goers, for whom the buffet is a working lunch. No wonder it has an offer on weekdays, where five people can enjoy the buffet, but pay for four diners. This ongoing offer is a hit with many guests.For main course, we ordered exotic vegetable in basil sauce. There was something nice about this dish as it was cooked in an unglazed clay pot; which meant that the dish retained most of its moisture heat and remains tender and flavourful.My co diner decided to try the General Tao diced chicken. This is one of MLC’s signature dish and all the ingredients blend together in soya sauce.When it came to desserts, sizzling brownie in chocolate sauce was a singular choice. It’s a rich, indulgent treat. It turned out to be a soft brownie oozing with thick chocolate sauce. One couldn’t have asked for more.It was a Birthday well spent, it was an enjoyable meal in a wonderful ambience, with the staff in full attendance.Kavitha",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d949963-Reviews-or130-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Feet Road, Bangalore

2891,50,22 July 2013,Worth the price.,"This is Indian Chinese at its best. I have tried almost all vegetarian dishes and I am yet to find even the smallest fault. They all were delicately flavored, well balanced and some of them are almost sublime. I believe the non veg section is equally flawless, according to the rest of my family. My all time favorite is Tofu fried in Hunan style. The tofu melts in your mouth as the peppers set your tounge and your palate on mild fire. I am sure that any dish picked from their menu will be prepared to perfection . Been going there for close to 5 years now. No complaints so far about the food, other than that it is becoming a bit too expensive. They have a small but good dessert menu too. The sizzling brownie is awesome, so is the coconut wontons with honey butter sauce. Both are rich and definitely can be shared by 2 people.Service is excellent. I hate to say this about them, but drinks aren't great, they have not mastered the art of making cocktails. I have been to the Mainland Chinas in Koramangala and Jayanagar , but the Domlur one stands out.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d949963-Reviews-or140-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Feet Road, Bangalore

We've been there couple of times for dinner and overall experience is great. Despite the fact that Chinese specialty means Non-Veg, we have still enjoyed veg food too (coz one of us is veg).Pretty Indian Chinese food rather than actual Chinese test but that is obvious for the crowd that they are targeting.

2912,40,4 February 2013,Good Food comes at a price.,"I went there yesterday for my friend's treat and am still burping of the dragon chicken and Wok Tossed Lamb and hunan prawns that came as starters...Although, I cannot comment on the authenticity of the chinese factor ( just because I have not been to china) but definitely, it was better than other chinese restaurants I have been to. Veg Dimsums tasted ""authentic"" (assuming) - bland, extremely soft, and stuffed to the core with the boiled salted veggies. But the pick of the day for me was definitely the Braised Crabmeat main course dish. It was pretty much to serve 4 people and with Plain Veg Hakka noodles, it simply made my day...There was an initial confusion related to the seating but that can be forgiven, given that the food was very good. So if you are like me ( who lives for food ), then this is definitely worth giving a try.The parking is at the basement for cars and the motorbikes, but ensure that if you have a car, be there early as the parking is not too big and it won't be able to accommodate more than 7-8 cars perhaps...All over..

Not only it was our birthday but we had also just finished a complete makeover session in a nearby beauty parlour & we had also planned to spend the rest of the afternoon chatting and relaxing after a very hectic week at work... Thus I suggested we should go to Mainland China Domlur branch as I thought they would be as good as the Church street branch... But I must say it was really disappointing... We arrived a little late for the lunch buffet and everyone was in a hurry to close the restuarant.. Therefore, the starters were served all at once and we could not take our time to relish them at our own pace.. even for the main course the waiter hurried us and even started to clear the other tables and arranging the furnitures to clean the floor. We felt cheated as we paid almost Rs1300 for the buffet but ended up leaving the place in flat 45 min, even though we had confirmed that they take the last order till 3.30pm... I understand that we were late, however the service could have been much better.. I had even informed the waiter that we are here to celebrate our Birthday but no one was bothered.. I would request the manager to be more careful about guest needs next time..

We have visited this place several times, and have been able to enjoy the variety and quality of dishes they served.However, our last two visits were highly disappointing. The quality of food has deteriorated, and they seem to act like they're unaware of it. We were served some vegetarian soup that was cooked with probably some meat broth. It was stinky, and we returned it immediately. The manager was a nice guy, and he offered another soup, but it was equally bad.We then ordered Sapo Tofu (if I recall it right) dish, which was basically ridden with MSG and tasted horrendous. We also noted that the price for a bottle of water was Rs. 60, and that was just insane. Their prices are 5 star, but their service or food is not.I feel sorry to give them this terrible rating, but there's not much I can do about it. It has now become highly commercial, and everything that was special about the place has become history.Never again!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297628-d949963-Reviews-or170-Mainland_China-Bengaluru_Bangalore_District_Karnataka.html,Mainland China, Feet Road, Bangalore

Chicken starters were hard and chewy, and not tender and juicy one expects. Chicken in the soup smelled foul.And yes, the dishes seemed to have the Indianized effects - read that as added with Indian spices.

The Cantonese, hunan, hong Kong and Peking style chicken in main course are awesome. The hakka noodles and also the rice are refreshing , great portions and leave a craving for more. The Am chopsuey are a fullsome menu and has oddles of flavour. The choco sizzler as dessert is fantastic. The ambience beautiful, sitting very private and cozy, the atmosphere romantic.

What restaurant offers is Indo Chinese fusion food, which is miles away from Chinese food. They offer both buffet services and ala-carte. Buffet has nice spread and decently priced.

After we paid, we approached the manager and complained. Rather than being apologetic he had a very casual attitude and made a “matter of fact” statement. “Yes I saw it and asked one of the waiters to kill it”.

2985,40,19 January 2016,Best for Chinese buffet,The Mainland China outlet in GK 2 is very close to my parents place. We went there for lunch and as always had a pleasant experience.The positive side is also that they have stopped using MSG in their dishes as we were informed. We went in for the lunch buffet and both the starters and the main course were sumptuous.The only negative was that we had to wait a long time for our bill to be cleared as there was something wrong with their credit card machine and it took the management some time to realise that and arrange for a second one.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304551-d799100-Reviews-or40-Mainland_China-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,Mainland China, Greater Kailash, Delhi

Our favorite and the very first Mainland China we visited when it opened.No table booking needed due to Shraadh but after 9:30 PM the place had a large waiting at the lobby level so it speaks for the popularity. We reached at 8:45 and were straight away shown the table. The service was good. Senior citizen gets 15 % off- please do keep in mind. Had Chicken & Won Ton soup, sipped Chinese tea for digestion and really enjoyed the meal. The meal was cooked to perfection. Chicken Haaka Noodles and Fired Rice was just perfect and the chicken dishes just right. Pomfret was tender and perfectly cooked.Truly value for money.

The previous one was a buffet lunch which i remembered very fondly for its value for money, variety and great taste.Whilst the main door entry is decent, the route to the second floor is through a rather old feeling shady type of lift which does not inspire confidence.We were lucky to be there on a Tuesday when it was perhaps not too crowded. The decor is fairly average.We had a vegetarian cuisine with a starter, soup, a main dish, noodles and a dessert. All items were made well and the chef was happy to personalize gravy levels to taste for example.They were sweet to put together a small chocolate cake and also sing happy birthday with a guitar which i think was a nice personalization.Their chocolate ice cream that i tried in the end was a bit of a dampener. Barring that, it was a nice experience with a warm set of people who cared for you.The total bill for this course was around Rs. 1800 including a 5% service charge which was decent when you count a pint of beer and a mocktail besides the food we hadTheir service was very prompt. We had to tell them to slow down in fact.I would recommend the place for food any day, especially their lunch buffet",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304551-d799100-Reviews-or50-Mainland_China-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,Mainland China, Greater Kailash, Delhi

2995,30,7 August 2015,Tuesday blues...,"Mainland China happened to be my ultimate fantasy for Chinese food. My experiences from eating there twice before had been truly enchanting, an exotic culinary journey into euphoria buoyed by taste and aroma. But our recent dinner in mid-July had been quite disappointing!Four of us including our young adult daughter and son visited MLC on a Tuesday evening and as anticipated crowd was quite thin considering many from the North are avowed vegetarians on that day of the week. We asked for chicken Siu Mai (6 pcs. – Rs.250/-) and steamed crabmeat (Rs.675/-) as starters and ordered a portion each of steamed rice (Rs.220/-), wok tossed chicken hakka noodles (Rs.380/-), wok tossed greens with garlic (Rs.480/-), sliced chicken in oyster sauce (Rs.520/-) and roast duck in chilli plum sauce (Rs.695/-). The crabmeat was a disaster and on pointing out that it did not taste like crab at all, it was replaced by a whole crab dish. In fact, in our earlier trip, we had liked crabmeat preparation very well and hence we went for the same this time too but what a letdown! Wok tossed greens with garlic only lived up to the repute of MLC but other dishes including hakka noodles were no great shakes! .I have a weird feeling that the regular chef had his weekly off on Tuesdays, which see minimal footfall in non-veg restaurants in Delhi and someone else was masquerading as the 'stop gap' chef scripting the fiasco!I am still not ready to write off MLC…that would be great massacre in Delhi's food scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304551-d799100-Reviews-or50-Mainland_China-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,Mainland China, Greater Kailash, Delhi

I am a lover of Chinese food and love the so called authentic (i know actually in china they make it differently) Cantonese style PAN fried noodles is awesome and one of my personal favourite (please ask them to make it with white sauce and without soya sauce), I am sure you would love the taste. Had also ordered General Taos Favourite Chicken and would rate it above average, however another of my personal fav would be Hunan Prawns (005).Food is awesome, service is excellent, the best part is the people taking orders have knowledge about the food and can be a good guide at time if you can be specific about your own taste buds.

3005,30,16 March 2015,Used to be much better,"A friend wanted to try Mainland China, and I had good memories of the place, so I overlooked the 3.8 rating on TripAdvisor. I should have paid more attention. It used to be excellent. This time, not so much.When we arrived, only one other table was occupied. Still, it took several minutes for the wait staff to give us any attention.When the waiter took our order, we made several clear requests regarding the timing of the service. The waiter acknowledged each request, but the expediters ignored them, bringing two dishes far in advance of when they were wanted. This type of problem seems to happen quite a bit in Delhi, but I don't expect errors like this at a fine establishment like Mainland China.One of the items I wanted was not available (this is another common problem in Delhi), so I let the waiter talk me into the 5-spice lamb chop special. If you're looking for a meaty, broiled lamb chop, don't order this dish. It was a few, tiny chops (Indian lamb chops tend to run very small compared to foreign ones) nicely softened (probably by marination) but seasoned with some sort of masala that I did not like, and that did not remind me of real, Chinese 5-spice. Also, the dish was served at room temperature rather than hot.The burnt garlic soup was excellent, just as it had been on my previous visit.The rest of the meal was forgettable for me. My dining companion, on the other hand, very much enjoyed his meal. I sampled his General Tao's (yes, it was Tao's -- around the world it's usually named General Tso's) chicken, and I thought the spicing was more Indian than what you'd find at a typical Chinese restaurant in the US where the dish was invented.Perhaps Mainland China has gone the way of most other ""foreign food"" restaurants in Delhi, realizing that they can only survive if they serve Indianized dishes. Perhaps, with the nationwide expansion of this normally excellent restaurant company (Mainland China, Sigree, Oh Calcutta, etc.) they cannot find or train enough staff to live up to their high standards. However, whatever the reason, I left the restaurant rather saddened at the decline.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304551-d799100-Reviews-or60-Mainland_China-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,Mainland China, Greater Kailash, Delhi

The food was good except the fact that the dimsums were a letdown as it was not soft, probably a little under cooked. Another letdown for me is crab with shell, it creates little problem I dining.

The main course with fish, chicken and crab was excellent, although you need to give rest to your stomach after you're done with the appetizers. We are not too adept in cutting-up crabs; so the friendly staff did the cutting job in their kitchen and got the crab to us served ready to eat without too much of a hassle: appreciated. The noodles and rice selection had non-veg varieties as well which were closer to authenticity as far as possible and needless to say: very tasty.

The man-size Terracotta Soldiers which greet you at the entrance provide the right ambience. The service is courteous and reasonably efficient. The starters, which are served on your table, have reasonable variety over seasons, though not all favourite items are available all the time, and the drinks menu seems to be severely limited in mid-range. The lunch buffet, after you've had your fill of the starters, has the usual mix of Indian-Chinese and authentic Chinese items to suit 'Indian palates'. And the desserts round off the fair. All in all, a good option in this part of town for a quick lunch (though not always in peace! - the 'kitty parties' which dominate during the day can be quite noisy).",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304551-d799100-Reviews-or90-Mainland_China-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,Mainland China, Greater Kailash, Delhi

After that, service for starters and soup was painfully slow at the buffet. Better would have been to help ourselves...The food was the saving grace.

The buffet is a fixed menu with a choice of soups, appetizers, main dishes and desserts and a Vodka-based house-drink to boot ! Food quantities for the buffet are unlimited; soups and appetizers are served at the table. The a-la-carte menu has a wide choice of food, alcholic and non-alcoholic drinks and a good choice of wines.The first floor restaurant has a lift for convenience of guests. Tables are well-laid out and the atmosphere is neat and the interior, clean, though often noisy with the chatter of guests ! Waiters are well-trained, efficient and polite and sometimes over-eager to ask your opinion on the food !The Restaurant has parking for its guests but this can often be full and it's best to go early unless you are chauffer-driven !

Yes their fish is still fresh but now it comes coated with a half-inch thick cornflour.Yes, they do change it and do a great job if you complain- but my point is why do i need to complain in Mainland China ?So average rating - and please rescue your buffet food from the cornflour..",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304551-d799100-Reviews-or110-Mainland_China-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,Mainland China, Greater Kailash, Delhi

The restaurant had impeccable interiors with right degree of illumination to set the mood for an enjoyable dining experience.As the starter, we ordered chicken with steamed straw mushrooms sautéed in ginger sauce (Rs.495/-) – the dish was excellent in taste and aroma; it was served in good measure, enough for four of us. Next on our menu were a portion each of Eight Treasure soup with seafood (Rs.220/-) and that with chicken (Rs.210/-) - the soups were good with toned down aromatic spices. The main dishes namely, Crab meat braised in sauce (Rs.650/-) and Duck braised in spicy hot sauce (Rs.650/-) along with the wok tossed veg hakka noodles (Rs.340/- for regular portion) worked wonders with our taste-buds.While the food at Mainland China was simply great in taste, the final bill is little steep with three-tier tax structure (service charge@10%, VAT@12.5% and service tax of about 5%)!

Been hearing about the ""Mainland China"" but never had the opportunity to visit in Delhi. Saw the restaurant in NOIDA (I work out of NOIDA). The close proximity from the office prompted me to go.Well trained - (too intimidating to my liking perhaps) overly courteous staff greet you and show you the table. The ambiance is good. Nice and cozy and the place is huge. Can accommodate a good size gathering easily.I am very finicky about the way food is prepared and presented. Mainland China, does it well. Very well presented and the chef seems to put his heart into the cooking.Have been a frequent visitor since they opened last month in March (the staff already know me by name).Menu is well placed and items worth a mention are Aromatic chicken with garlic, Konjee crispy lamb, Steamed Bekti fish, Hunan Chicken, Tsing Hoi Chicken, sliced chicken in Oyster sauce. Not a big vegetarian fan but stir fried mushrooms in ginger and chilli is worth the mention.In soups, have tried their peppery lemon, hot n sour, shangsi crab meat, and sweet corn. All good. Lemon coriander will be avoided in future cause it's thick with coriander and tastes all of coriander only.The menu is good and will take some time to try most of the items mentioned. However, I will not hesitate to visit frequently and try out most.All in all, a highly recommended Chinese restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304551-d799100-Reviews-or120-Mainland_China-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,Mainland China, Greater Kailash, Delhi

3066,40,28 March 2012,Good Ambience and authentic food,The Mainland china in GK 2 has very good ambience and the food specially the prawns are perfect for taste buds. The service was prompt and the drinks were good. My wife tried Margherita and I had a beer. For main course we tried the Pan fried Noodles with chicken and it was good. Allthough we asked them not to put a lot of veggis but it still had quite a few.The restaurant in itself is very cozy and good for couples night out dinner.

The restaurant is fairly large so there was no waiting, another good thing. The food was delicious. What more can one ask for.The fish in basil was the standout preparation.

3070,40,16 February 2012,Yummy,"This is one restaurant you can rest assured you will have a good time. They have mastered the Chinese cuisine, and their starters especially are amazing (I would recommend filling yourself with the starters actually :) ) The ambiance, too, is very pleasing. A bit on the higher end, but then it's a place for good occasions.Only one thing that didn't work for me- the waiters weren't great.

3071,40,2 February 2012,Excellent food and service,"Mainland China is my favorite Chinese food hunting ground in Delhi, hands down. It suits my palates, I like the staff, and the seating is quite comfortable. Everything that you order never disappoints you, including the super-yummy sea food. Go for prawns here. Even the duck is above average. I am not a soup person, but their soups are nothing less than great!The only downside in the my last visit, was the disappointing buffet where the quality of food was nowhere around the ala carte.

I cant agree that the Veg and Non veg platter was authentic. It was a concoction. Ok for a tasting Menu if the Chef was a Michelin rated one. Didnt suit our palate at all.

3082,30,11 August 2011,awesome punjabi chinese food but extremely noisy,"For those of you who are not aware of this concept, Punjabi Chinese is a form of chinese food which is quite prevalent in North India. You will find that PC restaurants have more 'zing' in the food than authentic chinese. Its a must try for people who have never tried it before. And with all due respect to all places in Delhi that try so hard to make PC, China Garden is a place where Delhiites always go for good PC in a slightly elegant setup.I love the food here. All the flavours of chinese food are there. Its just that the subtlety of chinese food was blasted with gamma rays and converted into the incredible hulk. the food is packed with spice and flavour so not for the light stomached.A word of caution though. This place is a favourite amongst housewives who congregate in loud groups known as 'kitty clubs'. The net effect is that you will feel like you are in a concert where music is played by scratching nails against a chalk board. If you have never had to have a meal next to a table of 20 middle aged women shouting across the table to each other, you are lucky. But you might have to tolerate this noise to eat here. But the food is worth the experience. If all else fails, theres always alcohol.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304551-d799100-Reviews-or140-Mainland_China-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,Mainland China, Greater Kailash, Delhi

3085,10,7 February 2011,PATHETIC IS NOT THE WORD... SOMETHING EVEN WORSE THAN PATHETIC,"Dear Sir,I along with my family went to Mainland China, Masjid Moth, Greater Kailash-II, New Delhi restaurant. We were a family of 10 pax. I've been an avid fan of ur restaurant's food & service. But on 30.01.2011, the Sunday, everything was mismanaged , right from the service to the food & beverages as well. The food was all cold, tasted pathetic & none of your boys knew how to handle a big table. It took more than 30 mins for your staff to get the things after ordering. & that too all cold food.We got a shock of our life when we were given 3 pegs Wodka Gorbatschow, instead of Grey Goose Vodka . When enquired the staff told insisted that they've given us Grey Goose only, but after asking the bar-man, he agreed to giving us Wodka Gorbatschow. My first choice was Absolut Vodka, which i was refused and i was forced to buy Grey Goose instead.The senior manager then gave us another round of 3 Grey Goose vodka, which he told the bar-man to pour in front of us & told us that he wouldn't be charging for 3 Wodka Gorbatschow.We could've created a good hue & cry over there over these issues, but we controlled ourselves in respect of other people sitting in the restaurant. I'm also attaching the bill along-with, for your reference. But all i'd lie to say i wasted my entire 18000 rupees, & more importantly an evening with close family members, who all were so upset over this.Gauravh Malhotra[--]",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304551-d799100-Reviews-or140-Mainland_China-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,Mainland China, Greater Kailash, Delhi

3089,10,17 June 2009,Avoid This Place- Mainland China- Rajouri garden,"I and wife tried their buffet on 13th June’09. This one has come-up recently and the buffet cost as compared to other Mainland China restaurants is rather less. This one offers Veg/Non-Veg Buffet @294.00 plus taxes whereas it usually costs Rs. 495.00 plus taxes at other places. On checking I was informed that it’s because:1. Introductory Offer2. Buffet not as lavish/big as other Mainland China restaurants.The place was rather full during afternoon with a few families & kitty party happening. To start off service was terrible with no one bothering to serve starters (are served at the table). The starters comprised of dimsums (chicken/veg) and were terrible. These things were so soggy that their bottom was coming off!! Then there was chicken in teriyaki sauce which was good but fried potatoes were passable. The buffet also consists of 1 veg & 1 non-veg soup which was ok & I could gulp down a few spoonfuls. The main course consisted of 5 veg & 5 non-veg dishes. The non-veg dishes included prawns, chicken & fish and sorry to say but all these were terrible. Prawns were limp & soggy, fish seemed like cooked in tomato sauce and chicken was more Punjabi then Chinese.Really don’t want to go on and on but to sum it up I’d suggest you avoid this place. There is nothing authentic about this joint. Seems like some franchisee using Mainland China name & dishing out the Chinese van type food.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g304551-d799100-Reviews-or150-Mainland_China-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html,Mainland China, Greater Kailash, Delhi

It started off as an excellent chinese restaurant- one of the few places that served authentic chinese food. The place is done up well. I have recommended it to several people in the past. But lately the service and food has been extermely dissapointing.The service till they drop you to the lift is excellent- after which is just goes down. The past 3-4 times they have taken about 10 mins to only get the menu, another 10-15mins to take the order, after several reminders. The food has been terrible- close to tasting like street dhaba chinese food. The last time, we went for a team outing with 17 people, and we wasted over half our food. everything was either too pungent or too salty, or too sweet, or was bland.

3107,50,2 January 2018,Crabs in the buffet menu,"Being a Chinese food freak, i have frequented almost all Chinese joints in South Delhi and amongst all, I find Mainland China the best in terms of ambiance, food choices, food quality and service. This resturant really makes you feel that if you shell out money, you are bound to get the best services. I have hardly come across any good resturant which offers chinese in buffet. And, crab....never at all.Inspite of being a bengali and taking a told to break the crab shell which i took, i will have to admit that having a crab like that is inconvenient. so maybe that can be avoided.

3124,10,18 October 2016,"Horrible Service, Horrible Staff, Horrible Food, Horrible Restaurant","This has to be one of the worst dining experiences of my life.I will put this in points so that it is easier for every one to understand why they need to avoid this place at all cost.1. Was shown to the table quickly enough. It was not particularly busy, had many tables empty.2. We were seated for a good 15 minutes before i had to approach the restaurant manager and have him arrange the server to be at my table. Manager also took this own sweet time to reach my table.3. All this while the server was busy arranging used tables when it was plainly visible that there were many other tables empty and his primary responsibility was taking care of existing occupants.4. Asked for a baby high chair as i was travelling with a toddler. I have attached pictures of the table. You will feel like vomiting when you look at it. It is beyond dirty and i cant comprehend how a restaurant which charges this much for a bowl of noodles will allow something like this to be kept inside the restaurant. How can you even think that i will make my 10 month old kid sit in it. People please do check that photo out and you will never want to visit this place again.5. Ordered a fresh lime soda with salt and got a flat drink with 2 table spoon full of salt in it. My baby could have made a better soda then this.6. Ordered a Tofu dish and hurrah, got one with NO, ZERO, NIL, NOT A SINGLE PIECE of tofu in the tofu dish. Can you beat that?7. Only saving grace was the noodles which were passable.Server Name: SirmanAvoid this place as if your life depends on it. When this restaurant can do this in front of the house, image what must be the state of affairs in the kitchen where you cant see.I think there were more things which happened there which i cant recall.

They have a good sized spread, fantastic appetizers which they serve at your table, drink or two and desserts. The dimsums, wings and prawns were excellent and served with individual sauces. The main course had a full spread comprising of fish, chicken and lamb, exotic vegs and soups. The dessert could have been better with some creative options but all in all a good experience, great food, great service and happy customers.

3156,30,30 July 2015,Good restaurant with its cons,"The food is good. Menu is not so varied. Mainland China seems to offer a limited range of cuisine for its buffet on any day, in any city. Dimsums had a weird taste, dessert was nothing great. What was annoying about service quality was that young guys were serving (around 20-21 years old) and one of them would let his hand brush against mine 2-3 times till i pointed it out to him.

First the positives: The food is good, we ordered 5 dishes and I would grade the food from Avg plus to exceptional. Kudos to the chef. Considering it was a weekend and the place was full, the service was quick. Now the negatives: When we entered the waiter said 'sorry no place', as I was about to leave he suddenly came up with one. I found that funny - was he trying to project the place to be pricey? The Air Conditioner was ineffective. When I asked a waiter he said the AC was being repaired by the engineers. After sometime when I asked another waiter he said the AC is defective but no engineers are avbl due to weekend. When it became unbearable and sweaty I called for the manager, and he came up with a good one. He said the place is full today that's why the AC is ineffective. Wow. Aren't restaurants supposed to be designed to cater for full load of guests? However there was no letup on Ser Tax when the bill came. I may go again to this place but now only in winters, not on weekends and only for food quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297615-d6219677-Reviews-or50-Mainland_China-Gurugram_Gurgaon_Gurgaon_District_Haryana.html,Mainland China, Raliance Mart, Gurugram

This was slices of lamb in a dark Mahogany colored sauce & large mushrooms. Super soft meat & awesome to taste overall. The eight treasure soup is really good and most of seafood tastes authentic, preserves the flavors and is not overdone or stinks which is typical in other restaurant.

3240,50,3 October 2017,Fabulous lunch buffet,"My wife and I walked into the restaurant as we were in the mood for Chinese food. It was a weekday, and so not overly crowded. We were ushered towards a table and informed we could opt for the lunch buffet and that starters were going to be served on the table. One look around convinced us that the buffet was really special. The menu was unique (we are non-vegetarians) and had a great array of chicken, seafood and lamb preparations that were far from the run-of-the-mill. We served ourselves the Talumein soup (excellent) and settled in for starters to be served. They were good, served hot and fresh but frankly took their time in coming. So after 3 rounds of different non-veg starters including fried prawn, we went for the buffet mains with rice/ noodle. Each dish competed with the other in taste and flavour! When it came to desserts, our favourite darsan with vanilla ice cream beckoned and there were a great variety of mango and chocolate flavoured cakes as well. We returned very happy with the value we got for the price. Only wish the starters were served with more attention.

Appetisers were served at the table and were good, best was the chicken and the fish. The dumpling were just OK and not greatly flavoured.

3312,30,8 August 2016,spicy Indian Chinese,"Went on Aug 7, a Sunday. Had a la carte (Crackling spinach, assorted vegetables in White garlic, ginger capsicum rice, wok tossed noodles, chocolate rolls with ice cream). These are now perhaps the very few of the non spicy items on the menu. Our bill came to a shade short of 1850/-.The staff of this outlet is quite pleasant.One thing I did notice this time round is how small the portion sizes have become. Whereas earlier the wok tossed vegetables (it's off menu now and has been replaced with assorted vegetables) was sufficient for 2.5 adults with room to spare, it's not even there for 2 now. The assorted veg dish has pok Choy, tofu which was nice, asparagus, beans et al and was decent but for the portion size. The consistency of cracking spinach has been maintained in the past 7-8 years we have tried it, albeit with smaller portions now.The majority of visitors on weekends opt for the buffet, where everything looks the same. Mostly Indian Chinese with items varying from spicy to moderately spicy. Alright for people who prefer spicy Indian Chinese. Have tried the buffet twice and subsequently limited to browsing and then settling for a la carte every time.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g644043-d3192147-Reviews-or130-Mainland_China-Noida_Gautam_Buddha_Nagar_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,Mainland China, K1 Plot, Noida

3356,50,18 February 2016,"Delicious delicasies, sans noisy brats!","In NCR, our most favourite restaurant for Chinese food is Mainland China, and of course, Oh! Calcutta for cuisines of Bengal. We look for occasions to eat out. So once again we reached there to celebrate the purchase of a new car.The quintessence of our meal pattern is we do not eat dinner. Therefore, always we look for places who offer delectable and delicious lunch.As before, the buffet lunch of Mainland China is something we all enjoy eating. For those who are toying between, to go, or not to go there for the lunch, I would strongly recommend them to give a try. If you are a lover of Chinese food, you will not be disappointed.Anyway, this time we loved Thai preperations also. Chicken and mutton preperations were also very tasty. In the end, I loved very much the pudding.Now the bad part of our lunch, for which Mainland China are not at all responsible. It is all about their guests. Like relatives, one can not choose a customer.There was a family of four or five with two rambunctious kids, surely suffering from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). They occupied a table on the other side of the aisle. In the process of playing a combination game of 'hide & seek' and 'musical chair' those kids broke glasses, tripped over the table, flown the cutlery with saucers and were constantly throwing tantrums. Either for not eating, or wanted to eat which were not available. The persons who were serving the items from buffet-lunch became exasperated. The proud and indulging parents were bemused looking at the exuberant vivacity of their kids.When the parents got fade up they set the kids free on the aisle for 'do-as-they-like'. That became too much to bear for other guests. They kept running all along the aisle. Tripped over many things. Invaded the cubicles to check what other guests are eating. Bumped against the persons serving food.We finished out lunch quickly and left the place. It was truly a nightmare in daylight for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g644043-d3192147-Reviews-or170-Mainland_China-Noida_Gautam_Buddha_Nagar_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,Mainland China, K1 Plot, Noida

3362,50,14 January 2016,Chinese Buffet Lunch,"I appreciate the entrepreneurship of Mr Anjan Chatterjee and Mrs Minoo Chatterjee, for not only being compatriot of Kolkata, but for their endeavour and zeal to always excel. At the same time, I take the liberty to suggest for a change in the lay out and decor of Mainland China at Noida, should this catch attention of the above persons.For the first timer, the thematic 'black' may provide a thrilling and mysterious feeling, but then it becomes dull and mundane for those who visit more frequently. This is precisely what we have experienced.Anyway, this is not the place to discuss the interior decoration. Therefore, let me share our experience of last visit.We observed on a previous visit the buffet during lunch hour. Though we ordered a-la-carte as usual, but we got tempted to try out on a later date. So we made it this time.Those who have not tried their buffet-lunch here, may please do so, if you are a lover of authentic Chinese food. The wide spread buffet would remind anyone of a scrumptious feast on a special occasion.Upon entering, we were ushered to our favourite table. We ordered a bottle of wine first. Then we found the warm hospitality, the kind we are familiar from 'Oh! Calcutta' too. I was hoping for some matching starter with red wine. Nevertheless, there were so many dishes that I could mix and match something for eating with wine.Two distinct types of preparations were there. Vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The later one had preparations of lamb, chicken, fish and prawn to tickle the tastebuds. There were soup, several dishes of starters, main courses, sweets, desserts and fruits.Though the members of staff are always eager to serve you on the table. Like in elaborate lunch or dinner, I normally take a look at all the preparations before eating. Accordingly, I decide the dish to eat and the serving. I go back also to re-visit a particular dish I liked more over others. The end result is a complete and satisfactory lunch. This time, I tried a new dish called, Burnt Garlic Chicken Fried Rice with egg. Mouthwateringly delicious.With these remarks, I close here. I wish you all a happy and prosporous time. Bon apetite.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g644043-d3192147-Reviews-or180-Mainland_China-Noida_Gautam_Buddha_Nagar_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,Mainland China, K1 Plot, Noida

3366,40,8 January 2016,Good and varied food,"The Mainland China buffet stands out among the buffets in Sector 18, Noida, in terms of value-for-money. There is a good variety of dishes, number of starters, and quite a number of delectable desserts. Food is tasteful, though, for the hardcore Chinese foodie, one would say that the sauces are too much repeated across the dishes, so sometimes it doesn't matter whether it was some chicken or some prawn dish. That said, it is a crowded restaurant during lunch times, as surrounding office folk come for their get-togethers. But, nevertheless, the experience is a nice one. There is segregation between groups with tall partitions, so that one does not, at least visually, get too disturbed by what is happening at the other table.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g644043-d3192147-Reviews-or180-Mainland_China-Noida_Gautam_Buddha_Nagar_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,Mainland China, K1 Plot, Noida

3402,30,19 June 2015,Cheap but low on quality,"I went for lunch with a business associate. Had buffet. Turned out to be far below expectation. Starters included dim-sum. But they did not have it ready and finally got them after we started main course.Even the taste of dim sum was not good as it had thick outer coating with little filling. Soup was not flavourful and had too much of soya sauce. Lamb was too chewy and fish tasted stale. Food appeared unappetising. It appeared that the food had been reheated several times before it was served.Though variety is good with about 4-5 options in veg and non veg each. Non veg included chicken, fish, shrimp and lamb. Dessert also had 3-4 options and cut fruits.Good part is the price. A buffet costs about Rs. 500.

3413,40,7 March 2015,Balanced Chinese food,"The main craze for Mainland China is about the authentic fusion of Indo-Chinese food.The restaurant is ideal for loud celebrations, I wouldn't recommend for candle light dinners.Footfalls is high so the lead time is typically 35-60mins depending on the dish.Staffs are very well educated about the recipes and preparations.I felt, they score high on Fried rice, and Noodles. The starters are not very impressive, and same is the case for soups. I got a whole ""bhetki"" last time, trust me that has been a source for future attraction...it'll let your pallets get very excited if you're fish lover.Overall, the best Chinese outlet in Noida.

This being my first visit to any Mainland China outlet, a lot of expectations had build up. But the chilli garlic chicken noodles, Jiang's chilli chicken, lemon pepper chicken soup and chicken spring rolls failed to be of the level expected in taste. Noodles apparently were over boiled and there was too much soya sauce in the chilli chicken dry while we had tasted spring rolls better in other restaurants.

3421,40,5 January 2015,North Indian take on Indo-Chinese Cooking,"The two lions flanking the entrance are the main hint of China; after that, everything is Indian. The restaurant is long, rectangular, airy, and spacious with mirror-lined walls and a coordinated decoration scheme of rectangles and blacks and grays with no touches of red or yellow as would be in a typical Chinese restaurant. The staff are courteous and ever-attentive, gliding in and out with food or whisking away empty plates; it would be a rare restaurant anywhere in the world that could top this level of service.The food is not the fusion of Indian ingredients with south Chinese recipes that originated with the Chinese Indians in Tangra, Kolkata but an interpretation of what Chinese people might like to eat if they were Indian. The menu lists dishes with approximate names or take-offs on Chinese names: e.g. dim sums for appetizers, and refers to tsin hoi sauce and the mahalak and maoshi cooking techniques that are most likely to be Indonesian and most probably not Chinese. What may be outrageous to a purist has nevertheless coalesced into a refined cooking style that pleases the palate and provides a vibrant dining experience.The kitchen scores high on Singapore noodles and vegetable fried rice. The crackling spinach is unusual but tasty and the crispy dumplings unbeatable. The potatoes and corn in tomato sauce (a.k.a mahalak) was a low point and the deep fried chicken appetizer tasted as if it had been marinated in tandoori paste and soy sauce. The shrimp in sichuan sauce were very good. At the end, the desserts were from the western world: brownies etc.The place was noisy and one had to shout to be heard across the table. Prices were on the high side for Chinese food albeit of good quality in an upscale place. While catering to vegetarians, the menu surprisingly does not list mapo tofu. Still, the restaurant meets the culinary expectations of its patrons and appears to champion an emerging cuisine on the lines of Malayan and Indonesian that is struggling to establish its culinary identity. If you bury the uncertainty in the way ""Indo-Chinese"" is defined by the owners of this chain restaurant and go with the flow, you will enjoy yourself and experience one of the pleasant surprises of traveling in India.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g644043-d3192147-Reviews-or240-Mainland_China-Noida_Gautam_Buddha_Nagar_District_Uttar_Pradesh.html,Mainland China, K1 Plot, Noida

3459,40,25 February 2013,"Good food, great ambiance and wonderful service!","Mainland China is one of my favorite places every time I want to eat Chinese (and that's all I prefer when eating out). Their NOIDA branch is no exception. Although the menu (all across the branches) is not very elaborate, everything that's served is good to go.Soups are all good but Peppery Lemon, Shangsi are always preferred by us.The Dimsums, specially the Sui Mai are our favorites. Anything that has ""Hunan"" and ""salt and pepper"" as a prefix on the menu should be tried. Bit on the spicy side but a good choice. Jiang's Chilli Chicken has a fine dark sauce/ sesame flavor to it while Aromatic chicken is a garlic lover's delight. Spicy fish in hotpot and freshwater whole Bekti (in Chilli Oyester sauce) is worth mentioning. Then you have Maoshi Chicken, General Tao's, Tsing Hoi and Braised Sapo if you are interested in poultry.Food is served well in time - Not too fast and not too late. Staff is amazingly helpful, courteous and always on their toes. We have made it a point that unless we try all the items in the menu, we won't move on to try another Chinese restaurant.Ambiance is nice and comfortable but do not go there in the afternoons. Hordes of old women having their ""kitty parties"". It's a cacophony and will remind you of an animal farm.I am a regular at Mainland China, NOIDA (visit at least once a month).

They have excellent service lead by an absolutely able manager.I love the way they stick to authenticity and don’t make Indo versions of the same.I was the only vegetarian in the group as usual and the entire family had the non-veg fare according to them it was lip smacking and I was busy digging into my fav items from their menu that I didn’t click pics of the non-veg fare.I had sweet corn soup (veg) the others had it in non-veg and hot and sour also in non-veg.In appetisers I had crackling spinach, Tofu in Hunan style along with corn and spinach dimsums.Main course for me was exotic vegetables in black pepper sauce. With veg fried rice and veg Hakka noodles.Everything was exactly the way it has always been.. perfect!! Veggies retaining their crunch and not being soggy. Hakka noodles not oily but retaining its authenticity cooked in mild sauces. As usual quite ambiance.The best was the dessert !!

3488,50,7 January 2018,Simply fabulous,"As an avid Mainland China fan trip to MLC Ahmedabad was a much awaited one. As is usual with MLC the lunch buffet was awesome, in particular the main course. Our request for Mustard fish was also entertained. What struck me most was the ambiance and decor. The crowd was thin for a Saturday which is a let down but probably Chinese does not suit the Gujrati palette. We were also delighted to meet the Manager Mrigank whom we had known from Mainland China Patna and getting to meet him after 3 years was the best part. What I appreciate about Mainland China is that they value in relationships and pay personalized attention to every customer.

3491,50,27 July 2017,The most authentic Chinese cuisine in Ahmedabad. Best value for money. Must visit.,"Me and my family visit this place very frequently and may be after 2 years also we find this place the best Chinese cuisine in any city.Seating arrangement is very comfortable and there is quite a privacy space between tables. Either a couple or a big group both can fit in, for groups you need to inform in advance.The ambience is very good and quiet and the light is soothing. You can take as much time in making up your order and in the meantime can ask them for some very good mocktail. Whether you are veg, even a Jain or you are n.veg, you will get ample choice to pick up from. The menu card itself is quite robust and if you have time can catch up with some information shared in the menu book, it is interesting....The food is excellent and well done, their chefs are really well trained. The spices are fresh which you can make out from the rich aroma of the food served to you. Between visits I never found taste different which means they have a strong discipline and procedure in their kitchen. This is must for a good Restuarant.Service is very polite and they are always attentive. It is still better to develop a rapport with the waiter, it always helps.In short I recommend this whole heartedly and wish every one a great meal here.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297608-d3181507-Reviews-or20-Mainland_China-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html,Mainland China, Satellite Police Station, Ahmedabad

3500,40,25 September 2016,Very good Chinese restaurant--from someone who knows,"Ordinarily, I would not go to a Chinese restaurant in India. Well, this had to be an exception because I wanted to celebrate the successful conclusion of a project and the group had chosen the place. (Win some, lose some.)To my pleasant surprise,the food was pretty good. The only authentically Chinese food I ordered was the dimsum dumpling platter as starter because I worried that my friends might not be able to take them. The dumplings were good.I also ordered the clear chicken soup and it was good, done to Chinese tastes: it had the right blend of colours, the right contrast in texture, the right mix of veg and meat, and the right taste. 2 thumbs up.All my friends enjoyed the food although I thought the Indian food had a little too much starch, done to Indian tastes I assume.They gave me and only me chopsticks.Service was pretty good; staff did try to serve food to you.Price was pretty good.Why would I not give it the highest rating?When we came in, they had a round table next to a square table. How can people interact? The point of a Chinese dinner is interaction. Chinese restaurants are noisy for that reason. The good food helps.Still, I'm likely to return if friends want a Chinese meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297608-d3181507-Reviews-or30-Mainland_China-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html,Mainland China, Satellite Police Station, Ahmedabad

The ambience is soothing and calming with unique artifacts all around has given it that perfect touch and the background music is soothing to the ears.As we all know Mainland China has been known for its buffet hence we went with that.We started off our meal with Chicken Shangsi soup which was like clear chicken soup with minced chicken(a little too bland for me but on adding a bit of soy sauce and pepper it tasted just amazing).In the Non Veg appetizers we were served diced chicken with assorted pepper and ginger and Chicken Rice ball. The ginger chicken was soft while the chicken rice call was amazing in taste. Even the veg starters spring roll and cottage cheese were good.The main course was however the best part. They had chicken noodles,chicken rice,chicken in devil's sauce,prawns in hubei sauce,fish in hot pot sauce and salads. All the things were delectable but the highlight was the fish it was too soft and literally melt in mouth. The desserts included Carrot Cake,Darshans,Strawberry Pannnacotta,Vanilla Ice cream and chocolate sauce. The best dessert was carrot cake,the strawberry one tasted really bad and certainly needed improvement. On the whole it is a good place for a quite lunch or dinner and if you thrive on chinese you should definitely visit this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297608-d3181507-Reviews-or40-Mainland_China-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html,Mainland China, Satellite Police Station, Ahmedabad

You would see all the dragons , buddhas & Feng Shui symbols to keep reminding you that you are at the Chinese restaurant.Prices are above average and a good meal for 2 can easily cost not less than Rs. 1,500.00 if you order atleast 3 items from the menu with drinks.Coming to Food, the menu is rich with traditional items and also wide variety at that.Since i am vegetarian my review will cover only Vegetarian food review.I recommend the DIM SUM which is superb, they are balls of dough covering a filling inside, which you dip inside different sauces and enjoy.The noodles were well cooked with all aromas, the friend rice is excellent.Overall, it is a no-brainer to choose this restaurant to enjoy a super Chinese food experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297608-d3181507-Reviews-or40-Mainland_China-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html,Mainland China, Satellite Police Station, Ahmedabad

The menu card clearly shows you that a particular item is spicy or very spicy.

The entire feel of the restaurant is very very upscale and it looks and feels kinda posh. An excellent place if you want to impress your date or have people visiting from out of town or want to entertain an important business associate. The staff is extremely polite and very attentive. The ambiance and lighting is perfect and the traditional Chinese feel is charming! The food is really very good if you like authentic Chinese cuisine. I recommend that you must try their assorted dumplings platter, soft corn cubes and Singapore noodles (if you prefer thin noodles over the traditional ones). The prices are bit on the higher side but like I said it is a place for upscale fine dining so it is expected. But the food and service is absolutely worth paying for.

Located in Gulmohar Park Shopping mall, it is accessible from everywhere and the most important is that there is no problem of Parking as the mall has 2 floors of basement parking.Ambience: the ambience in the restaurant is good. Though it can be made better by placing the tables a bit apart. Tables are set in too close to each other. As usual, very noisy crowd. People talking at high pitch without any regard for other sitting nearby. But then, I do not think that restaurant can do anything in this.Staff: Courteous and well trained, though the one serving us was ""odd man out"" as he had an attitude problem. I have been to this restaurant many times, but this is the first time that I saw someone like this.Food Options: As we had been there on a sunday for lunch, we had the option of buffet too. There is a good spread in buffet. But then, there are good choices in a la carte and is difficult no to order their famous ""Clay Pot Fish"". This dish is awesome!!

Since it's a Fine Dine restaurant so expect it to be a little pricey as compared to other Oriental cuisine joints in the city like Momoman, Mark Pi's Crazy Noodles or China Town.The menu spoils you with options of Oriental Cuisine. Some of them not available in other Chinese/Oriental restaurants. Add to that a wonderful ambience. The interiors are well done.The staff is courteous and wonderful.

3634,30,22 May 2017,Standards gone down,"The standards on all counts have gone down. Started as a speciality restaurant serving quality Chinese food, it has maintained the exclusivity but down on service, food quality and promptness. I had problems in the last four or five times of getting very salty dishes, for which I had complained. Probably because of Ajinomoto, which they said they do not use. The barbecue fish served yesterday does not resemble anything nearer to any fish. It is reeked in a sauce and tastes only of sauce. I could not eat even quarter of the portion served. The boy ho served was not bothered about the complaint and offered to give the balance to me packed !!! Nobody else was ther to take a complaint or ask why such large quantity was kept as leftover. The only redeeming item was the soup, which did not land me in soup. My dinner hence was limited to soup. Hopefully good for keeping a diet.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297613-d2062787-Reviews-or50-Mainland_China-Vadodara_Vadodara_District_Gujarat.html,Mainland China, Genda Circle, Vadodara
3635,40,2 May 2017,Little Bit Disappointed,"Day before yesterday night we happened to be at Mainland China for our dinner . After our last visit two years ago it seemed the hall was modified to accommodate more guests . Still as the guests were very well mannered the privacy of communication among the guests was maintained .We had ordered Lemon coriander veg , Lemon coriander thick nonveg soup and Sweet corn veg soup . All the soups were of excellent quality . Alongwith the soups we enjoyed Crisp fried garlic mushrooms . As main course we asked for Chicken fried rice, Fish in Devil’s sauce , Fried rice mix veg, General Tao’s favourite chicken , Prawns Hubei style , Butter roties and Butter garlic naans . As mocktails we enjoyed our Fruit punch ,Mint storm and Watermelon & Cilantro crush . All the main dishes we savoured . Fish and chicken were very tender and luscious .Only problem was with our waiter . He was not well trained . While serving the Crisp fried garlic mushrooms he spilled couple of them . Moreover he was not attending us properly .In retrospect compared to my last visit , I would say the highest standard achieved by the Mainland China earlier could not be maintained .",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297613-d2062787-Reviews-or50-Mainland_China-Vadodara_Vadodara_District_Gujarat.html,Mainland China, Genda Circle, Vadodara

3681,40,16 May 2016,The best in Chinese,The fried spinach and crispy lamb are everyone's favourite. The dimsums are the best and the new ones with basil flavour were interesting.

3682,10,30 April 2016,DO NOT GO ON SATURDAY,This place used to be nice but we came here today I..E on 30th April for dinner. First when we entered the place there was no one to attend us so we decided to help ourselves and sat. Then we waited for someone to give us the menu card but all in vain and finally we asked someone to give it. We ordered vegetarian dimsums. It took a lot of time for it to come and then when it came everything was cold. We had to wait for around 15-20 mins for our main course to come. I. Asking the winter kept saying 2 mins without even checking in the kitchen. When we asked him to call the manager he didn't call the manager but rather suddenly our food was ready.

3698,50,10 February 2016,Best place for Chinese food in Baroda,"Excellent food, served in soothing ambiance. The food is not the Indianised version of Chinese food with spices added, but it is bland and tasty.The proportions are enough for two. The place is on the higher side and it will be value for money to go in a group of 2 or more people.I usually prefer this place to celebrate some important family event like an anniversary - with just 2-3 family members.On most nights, I have found place here, without reservation. They also have additional space at the back of the restaurant, which they open up when there is rush on weekends.The mocktail bar is very cool and dishes out some awesome drinks. The starters are also very tasty. Be ready for wait time of 15-20 minutes after you place your order.

3699,10,7 February 2016,Main Land China Serves Tofu Pad Thai Noodles to an Order of Chicken Pad Thai Noodles,"I asked an online delivery agency (Delfoo, Vadodara) to deliver Chicken Pad Thai Noodles from Mainland China, Vadodara today(order id: 223328, dated 7th February 2015). They came and delivered a sealed product in Mainland Land China's packet. I opened it, and to my astonishment, I found a container full of noodles and a bit of spice and hardly three or four pieces of tofu incorporated therein. No chicken at all. When the restaurant was contacted they immediately replied that they provide tofu pieces along with other things in their noodles. When they were told that there is nothing else except a few pieces of tofu( just 5/6 potato chips like pieces), they didn't reply. They charged for this low quality, less than street food material for Rs. 370 bucks!I think people should believe those reviewers who gave a very poor mark to Main Land China, Vadodara",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297613-d2062787-Reviews-or120-Mainland_China-Vadodara_Vadodara_District_Gujarat.html,Mainland China, Genda Circle, Vadodara

3703,20,3 January 2016,"Bad service, Worse food","Do not visit this place if you are fond of Mainland China, for this place will kill that feeling. Its decked up in commonplace decor, feels pretty stuffy there. Service is tardy, and bad- the waiter actually put his thumb in the plate and glass while placing the things like you would expect in a dhaba. Of the things we ordered, Eight Treasure soup was tolerable; they did not know of chilly plum sauce, so they brought sweet and crispy chicken which was pretty bad and had a bad smell to it like raw meat. Tsing Hoi chicken tasted different, and had a lot of cashews in it. They didn't have Black pepper fried rice, so they served regular chicken fried rice which was okay; and chicken hakka noodles which was a stinking and sticky mess, easily the worst I have ever had.

3705,40,29 December 2015,Lovely ambience but the food could do much better,"I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. I suppose by Baroda standards, this is the only Chinese restaurant that comes near to what one may term as fairly fine. I have frequented it for lunch with friends and gone for the buffet. As we were 3, we had ordered a mix of vegetarian and non vegetarian. I was so pleasantly surprised at the type of noodles they serve. For the brand name, I would have expected a better version of egg noodles that we are so used to seeing in Chinese restaurants overseas. Another thing the portions were way too tiny and the vegetarian dish that we ordered for my brother seemed to struggle for vegetables. I have noticed with most restaurants in Vadodara, whether it be Chinese or Punjabi the crowd does not ever seem to realize that they are served more gravy and masala than the vegetable itself!!! My expectations for this restaurant were much higher. They do not match up to their Bombay sister branch. Hope that they will take note of my comments as a food critic.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297613-d2062787-Reviews-or120-Mainland_China-Vadodara_Vadodara_District_Gujarat.html,Mainland China, Genda Circle, Vadodara

3725,20,16 September 2015,Do not order delivery,"Granted, Chinese food in Vadodara is scarce, but I would still avoid this place. I had food delivered. First - the packaging. Fried spring rolls sealed in a metallic bag? They arrived a soggy mess. Second - the food itself. I made a few orders from their ""dim sum"" menu. Dim sum is not over steamed gelatinous dumplings further turned to goo by smothering them in a sauce of unknown origin. My god. I threw it all out it was completely inedible. The rice dish I ordered was technically edible, but completely flavorless. I did get some halfway decent coconut dessert dumplings - so I suppose they do have the technology to make a decent dish when they chose to use it.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297613-d2062787-Reviews-or140-Mainland_China-Vadodara_Vadodara_District_Gujarat.html,Mainland China, Genda Circle, Vadodara

If you're going for their hot (spicy) dishes, make sure you can handle them!On a weekend, go a bit early unless you are willing to wait for at least half an hour.

3732,40,13 July 2015,Sweet and Sour Chinese at its tastiest -Try its ICICI Feast,"Vadodara Central Mall has best location and in it at the top floor you are lead to a TOP chain of restaurant branch of Main land China Anjan Chatterjees creation.It all began when he began his effort to please Mumbaikars at Nana Chowk Hotel Rosewoods restaurant ONLY FISH back in 1990.s.Now more than 17 brands created by him and more than 100 branches all across the world. Main land China is his popular one but closest to his heart must be O Calcutta Bengali cuisine spread.OK,we went after a long time wanting to treat our buds and fill our stomach with as much food as we father and son duo could accompanied by my wife a silent Vegetarian who helps us in trying out the Veg fare. No body tells you to but see the pamphlet on your table shouting out that if you have a ICICI card they offer you have right to wallop a Chinese TREAT no single stomach ever can fill up with! At the end of it6 all as I forgot to even take a Picture of the vast spread they put in as veg non veg fare for we three , I had to tell them that they should give it all in smaller bowls !they did not agree on one request though to pack some of it undisturbed in a doggy bag to give it away while going home-not to waste food as even best European restaurants do! They should all should and avoid precious waste without being pompous! You go with a card and enjoy the feast which begins with a soup which we hardly sipped to make way for tastiest starters one can caress ones buds with. Barbeque fish and Chicken balls with sweet sour sauce was good and tender. Potato strips, Crispy veggies were as usual great. Steamed cottage cheese Dumplings were as good as one expects the ''hi fi momo joint'' to be!Jasmine tea and great crunchy cucumber strips one can never get any where else are on table.So are the green onion greens with pepper or one mustard sauce.Main corse has mushrooms exotoic veggies all types of rice noodles and fish and chicken for non veg. One cannot exchange it with a prawn dish though!!The end is near as you cannot eat most of it. But when dessert of honeyed noodles flat flakes, with chocolate filled fried wonton and vanilla ice cream arrives your stomach makes a way for them whatever!!!Service tax is on service charge only. They charge Service tax on Total bill that is wrong in all restaurants. Cry out or avoid tips then as I did painfully! AS they already take 10% service plus a tax on it too !!apart from Other taxes. But at 775 net -675 declared by them- you get food worth a lot more so enjoy this offer ,take the right card though!!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297613-d2062787-Reviews-or150-Mainland_China-Vadodara_Vadodara_District_Gujarat.html,Mainland China, Genda Circle, Vadodara

It is a perfect refinement of Chinese food made to suit Indian taste buds, with lots of spicy and super spicy options. Service levels are pretty good and salads that accompany main course are also amazingly unique. Do go for a nice Chinese curry with one out of the variety of rice available. I request the visitors not to restrict themselves to traditional noodles, choupsey or fried rice (we did that for our first 3 visits, being vegeterians there was a resistance to try even new veg curries).

3803,50,31 March 2013,The Best Food and Service We Ever Had,"We happened to be in the Restaurant for our dinner on the Good Friday . As soon as one enters she is welcomed by more than life size 3 statues of Chinese nobles in the spacious waitng lounge .We were led to our table in a very well furnished about 60 seated dining hall . I was very pleased to see lot more space between the tables so the guests were not compelled to listen others personal conversations .The menucards were rich in appearance and nicely preared . Only problem was little but vital informations about the ingradients and recipe of the dish were missing and some items were repeated . I noticed Peppery lemon veg soup in two categories . I think its always better to have different items under different categories . Of course this is my personal view .As we were not terribly hungry , we ordered for Orange pirojka and Alaska glass mocktails , Peppery lemon veg soup , Fish in spicy hot pot and Fried rice mix veg . Mocktails were really chilled and had slight hint of tanginess . We never tasted such a carefully prepared soup . The brocolli ,carrots , lettuce , mushrooms , etc . were so well cooked that they were crispy and tender . The soup was aplenty and tangy & enough peppery .The fish was not very spicy but it was brought in a pot and was kept hot on a little Shigadi . Fish was delicious . Fried rice was excellent . Both the fish and rice were more than enough for both of us .Let me tell you one thing . Additional sauces were not provided but the food was so authentically cooked that there was no need to add anything.The one thing we appreciated the most was the waiter was very attentive . We never served ourselves . I have frequently noticed elsewhere that waiter serves on first two occassions and then comfortably forgets the guests . Thus we were quite impressed by the ambience , food and service .It was not out of place to put on record that though we declined the chinese tea , it was offered us two more times .In a nutshell we enjoyed our evening meals .",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297613-d2062787-Reviews-or220-Mainland_China-Vadodara_Vadodara_District_Gujarat.html,Mainland China, Genda Circle, Vadodara

Could be less salty.MAINCOURSE :Fortune Clay Pot Vegetables :Fresh veggies with water chestnuts made in a fortune sauce which is made in house. It is so good that you need to eat with an accompaniment.Stir Fried Haricot Beans With Chillies & Sesame :A simple yet saporous flavour of chillies and sesame seeds.Chicken With Celery & Wine :A white translucent wine sauce with celery that went well with it. The chicken was also made very nicely. ❤️Sichuan Steamed Fish With Fresh Coriander :A very appetizing gravy with the aromatic flavour of coriander. This was so delectable.Celery & Chinese Cabbage Fried Rice :This rice was very savory and delicious. It went complimented well with all the main course dishes.Singapore Style Fried Noodles With Scallions :This was having a very different and good taste.

Food quality is excellent and maintain the reputation of good preparation. However it was observed foods are more spicy this time - either we had visited during Chinese New Year Festival period or they have made changes intentionally to make it spicy to meet customer taste.There is no Valet parking but enough common parking space is available in basement area. Unfortunately entrance to the Restaurant from parking lot is not pleasant as it is not clean and not exclusive to Mainland China client,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or40-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune

They told me they will deliver instead. Upon opening the delivered food we've noticed there's no chopsticks or even plastic spoon for the soup. They know I'm staying in the hotel so I don't have any access to any cutleries inside our room and they didn't even mentioned they don't provide them. I rang the manager and he told me they don't give any and when I said was he expecting me to eat the soup straight from the plastic container, he told me to request cutleries from the hotel instead.

3874,10,7 March 2017,Chewy wanna-be Chinese cuisine - bad!,"The worst thing a restaurant menu can turn into is neither this nor that - because that's when McD becomes a preferred choice. Look, if you aren't serving Chilli Paneer anymore because you've become 'shi-shi fancy-shmancy', then please get your paneer substitute, tofu, right! When deep fried tofu - they claimed it was stir fried - is chewy, it means it is stale and/or refried hard, it's an insult to Chinese cuisine. When the 'General's' chicken has more doughy chewy cornflour and unknown chicken parts - it's stops being a 'general's cuisine'...some nice Indian starter snacks but again not fresh - corn 'chaat', nice gujju touch, was also not made of crisp and juicy bits of corn, but instead chewy and retired yellow somethings...sorry MC, you need to rehaul everything and your chef in your kitchen - keep rest of your staff, it was the only saving grace of our meal yesterday afternoon. And by the way, it's not 'Dimsums', plural - it's 'Dimsum', singular.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or40-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune

3952,10,15 November 2014,Quality of food and service takes a beating,"Happened to be in Pune and decided to go for dinner to Mainland China. Ooops....big mistake!Chinese food in India is not known for it's hygiene and this restaurant exemplified it. They added to the notion that you can never be careful enough when going down the Chinese food route.For starters, the cutlery on the table had FOOD STAINS on it. Ugh! I called the manager and showed it to him and he nodded nonchalantly as if it were a daily occurrence. No sweat, pulled out a fresh (sic!) one and put it on my table.My son asked for a diet pepsi and the waiter brought him a Jack Daniels. Wow! Hearing aids needed here...After we ordered food, to my horror the water served me vegetables whilst resting the bottom of the plate on the rice that was already on my plate. God knows where they keep the serving dishes while waiting to pour the food on it for serving, so the underside of the serving dish was something i certainly did not want resting on my food.My appetite went for a six and my opinion of the place went to the pits. Being popular doesn't necessarily mean that the quality will be great. The excellence lies in the small things and obviously the emphasis on hygiene is not on top priority here.Highly avoidable!",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or120-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune

3970,20,26 August 2013,"Pathetic service, Small portions, Expensive","This was not the first visit I had to Mainland China - ICC. However, this was the worst of all visits and needs a special mention here. While booking I was told that coming early would be better since tables are full post 2000hrs, however while we left at 2120, tables were still available.Drinks - We were told that wine by glass is not served at all and only by bottle would be available, which is such a big limitation on choice for the entire family who would want to have separate drinks.Soup - We ordered for soup and mix of non alcoholic drinks and breezer eventually and they were all good.The complimentary kimchi and cucumber salad was good and when we asked for a refill, for a long time nobody came and when they did they rudely put across a huge bowl of each, in front of us, as if they are protesting asking for more of this.The starter was very small in portion and we were told that they have now started the concept of portion size for starters as well. Noting that we ordered for a Large portion of Golden Garlic Fried Rice with Iceburg lettuce and Corn & potato - large portion, both of which have had an big cutdown on its portions.To add to that the server spilled rice on two out of four of us which is such a disaster.The bill as usual was huge. The summary is that the portions are lesser, taste is not as good as before, the service has terribly deteriorated and the cost continues to be very high",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or140-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune

3977,30,27 March 2013,Comparitively Subpar,"This is the worst Mainland China I have been to. The food is sub par. If I wanted so much oil in my food I would go to a street side chinese wala gaadi. The staff doesn't know how to pronounce their dishes, let alone describe them properly. After one horrendous experience in December, I have steered well clear of this one, DP road and Aundh ones will be something to look out for.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or150-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune
3978,30,18 March 2013,Good Food bad Reception...!!!,"We reached the Place at 8.40 PM , as there was not arrangement for Valet parking ,we parked the Car in the basement of the building . There was no stairway to the top for Mainland China , we need to walk thru the same slope from which we came down with our car.We entered thru Main Entrance, Tiamangla was standing at the reception to greet us, she asked us if we have a reservation , I said yes at 9 PM. She check the register and told us to wait as table is getting ready.As we waited for around 3-4 minutes she asked us to come with her , she took us to a table near the Bar and close to the kitchen door.Manoj came to our table and asked us for the preference of our drinking water , bottled or normal. He gave us the food and drink menu.And filled our glasses with water.I ordered our Soup and maincourse dinner to Partho. Manoj brought the drink soup first and left the table, after 5 minutes he brought my drink , Ginger Pineapple frappe. the photo of the same in the attachment.After we finished out soup , we waited around 20 minutes minimum before someone served us the main-course.Mongil cleared our table and then severed us the main course. During our main course , when we needed help to serve the food, no one was around so we served it ourselves.After the main course was complete JEET KC came to our table and asked us if we like to have anything in desert, We asked him to bring the bill ,he esquire from us if we have SPECIALITY Card , we said we didn't have it right now.After 2-3 mins he presented the bill to us, I kept my credit card, and he brought the creditcard receipt, I signed it and left the place.Points of Concern:Too much noise from Kitchen . Both of utensils and people inside.Attendants were too much busy with other guest they forgot sometime that someone is waiting , in middle of there dinner.There was No Musicmain course dinner plate was not warmNo chinese tea offeredNo valetNo greetings",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or150-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune
3979,40,26 December 2012,Great food!,"Had organized a reunion of friends in this restaurant on christmas eve; and mainland china didnt disappoint us!Table booking was possible over phone and table was kept ready at required time. Staff helped us choose the right apetizers, drinks and the main course. Chicken in hunan style, crackling spinach were really tasty. Buffalo bull drink could've been better in terms of presentation.Service was satisfactory; at times I felt they could've responded a bit faster. Can be considered as an improvement opportunity.Overall, good food and good ambience! Would recommend to all age-groups, and too vegetarians too.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or150-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune

3982,50,23 November 2012,China at Pune,Excellent chines food. Authentic as name connotes. Fast Service starts with green tea and serves excellent food.

3984,40,17 October 2012,Indian Chinese,"Went to this restaurant with friends yesterday. The interior is good, although perhaps a little minimalistic. I guess that's this chain of restaurants style.For those that think that this servers authentic Chinese, you will be disappointed. Mainland China serves Chinese food with an Indian twist. (ref. Indian Chinese cuisine at wikipedia).The food is good, and they have a multitude of dishes to choose from, ranging from mild to spicy. The seating arrangements are also good, and would suit couples, families and business dinners.For the kids, I guess the dessert menu is what they're all waiting for, and the desserts are really good.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or150-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune

3988,20,17 June 2012,Indianized Chinese Loaded with MSG,"This is a very popular chain for Indian Chinese cuisine in many parts of India. The reason for its popularity is of course because it caters to the vast majority of Indians who think of manchurian, hakka noodles, sweet corn soup and spring rolls as Chinese, specially if it comes loaded with MSG (most Indians have no clue what this is). If you tell the manager you want your food without MSG ( a very normal request in Chinese restaurants around the world), he will stare at you as if you have come from another planet! That should be your cue to walk out of the restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or160-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune
3989,40,22 January 2012,Large attractively set out restaurant with attentive staff.,This restaurant is part of a plaza with other restaurants close by including North Indian and Italian. On the edge of the plaza it is not difficult to find as the red lights shine brightly in the evening. A popular restaurant with a good atmosphere and plenty of seating. The food was of a good quality and staff were attentive without being intrusive. I would recommend you give this a try if you like chinese food.I doubt if you will be dissappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297654-d2412511-Reviews-or160-Mainland_China-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html,Mainland China, Pyramid Mall, Pune
